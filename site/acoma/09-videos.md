## Emergence: Acoma Sky City Cultural Center, Full Documentary

The Haak'ume people of Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico were faced with a challenge when their visitor center burned down in 2000: How to reconstruct a place that was as welcoming to their people as to visitors, would tell the story of their people, and also be a bridge between cultural and 'green' interpretations of sustainability. What they created was much more than that. This is the story of the Place that the architects and the Haaku'me people created together.

## Acoma Pueblo Culture and Language

This compilation contains content that was edited out from our documentary, Emergence: Sky City Cultural Center and the Architecture of Acoma Pueblo. These sections of oral history were so special, we decided to re-edit to offer a small insight into Acoma's culture and traditions. This offering is a gift for our Acoma grandmothers, Marilyn Ray and Prudy Correa. May your words and traditions carry on. ♥
