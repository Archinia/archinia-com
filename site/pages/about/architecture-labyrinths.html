<p>I opened my first preservation practice in 1996 while I was attending Texas A&M University's Master of Architecture program. After graduating, I worked as a project manager for traditional architecture firms from 1998-2008. I have run my hybrid architecture and preservation practice and non-profit since 2008.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects of my career is that it has not always been about architecture… I've also designed or consulted on labyrinths as well as sacred spaces for different religions around the world.</p>

<p>While I do not design anymore, I still regularly consult (link to svcs/consulting) on architecture and preservation projects.</p>
