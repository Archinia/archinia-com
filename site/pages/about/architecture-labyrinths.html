<p>I opened my first preservation practice in 1996 while I was attending Texas A&M University's Master of Architecture program. After graduating, I worked as a project manager for traditional architecture firms from 1998-2008. I have run my hybrid architecture and preservation practice and non-profit since 2008.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects of my career is that it has not always been about architectureâ€¦ I've also designed or consulted on labyrinths as well as sacred spaces for different religions around the world.</p>

<p>While I do not design anymore, I still regularly consult (link to svcs/consulting) on architecture and preservation projects.</p>
