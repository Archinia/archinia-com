<p>I opened my first preservation practice in 1996 while I was attending Texas A&M University's Master of Architecture program, while also working as a research assistant for one of the top expert witness architects in the country. After graduating, I worked as a project manager for traditional architecture firms from 1998-2008. I have run my hybrid practice since 2008.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects of my career is that it has not always been about traditional architecture… I've also designed or consulted on labyrinths, sacred circles, and spiritual architecture for different religions around the world, including a Shinto temple in Japan, a cross-shamanic ceremonial center in Peru, as well as Christian, Catholic, and Unitarian churches, a Hindu temple, and a Sufi shrine in the US.</p>

<p>While I do not design much anymore, I still regularly <a href="https://theministryofarchitecture.com/our-work/consulting">consult</a> on architecture and preservation projects.</p>
