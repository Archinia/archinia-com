<h2>Designer ~ Storyteller ~ Catalyst</h2>
<h3>Celebrating architecture, culture, and lifestyle in the desert southwest.</h3>
<p>I work with historic sites, cultural centers, tourism organizations, architects and preservationists, and media outlets to produce relevant, engaging multi-media content that emphasizes the personal experiences that set a place apart. I have explored architectural and cultural perspectives from Okinawa, Japan to Santa Fe, New Mexico to Vicenza, Italy.</p>
<p>I harness my passion for the <em>Genius loci</em> - Spirit of Place - to help clients improve engagement and awareness, fundraising potential, and social engagement (likes and shares) - which means dollars spent at your venue!</p>
<p>My influence is not in my reach or # of unique visitors... itâ€™s in my authentic connections. Myfriends and fans love what I do, and then go do it themselves. <em>Plus</em>, I have an eye for on-the-fly iPhone shots which makes me different from other influencers... I cover events extensively <i>as they happen</i>, which builds buzz and encourages visitorship for an immediate return.</p>
<p>I have been recognized as Yelp's "Queen of Santa Fe" for many years and was a Yelp Elite for 7 years.</p>
