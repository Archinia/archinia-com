		<p>Rachel’s key message is that <strong><em>each of us is here to change the world</em></strong> and that <strong><em>we have to trust and cultivate our gifts</em></strong>.</p>
		<p>Rachel’s work, and especially her talks, encourage and engage that part of many people that “always wanted to be an architect”, so that we can find more enjoyment in our lives through interacting with built space, design, and art.</p>
