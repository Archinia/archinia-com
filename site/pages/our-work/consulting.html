<p>I often consult on hiring architects and building committee training, pairing job candidates with placements, reviews for Arts and Culture based research, finding film locations, book and product beta testing and reviews, and the like.</p>
<p>I also do place-based curations of panels, tours, talks, magazines, and exhibits. Should you need a hand, please reach out and I'll let you know if I can help.</p>
<p>My rate for consultations is typically $100/hour, but I am happy to negotiate, and barter when it is mutually beneficial. <a href="mailto:intentiondesign@gmail.com?subject=Consulting%20Request">Email me.</a></p>
