<p>I often consult on projects such as: helping architects maximize the value of their marketing wins, helping people find and hire the right architects, building committee trainings, pairing job candidates with placements, airbnb design, reviews for Arts + Culture / Preservation / Historical research and reports, finding film locations, book and product beta testing and reviews, and the like. I also coach coaches to hone their messaging to reach new audiences.</p>
<p>I also do place-based curations of panels, tours, talks, magazines, and exhibits.</p>
<p>Should you need a hand, please reach out and I'll let you know if I can help.</p>
<p>My rate for consultations is typically $100/hour, but I am happy to negotiate, and barter when it is mutually beneficial.</p>
