	<p>In doing work that falls outside the traditional bounds of design and preservation, we often get to participate in groundbreaking research into new ways of seeing buildings and landscape in relation to its environment. Our research has included: Sustainable Design, Pattern Languages, Vernacular Design, Archaeology, Critical Regionalism, Bio-Climatic Design, Design Theory, Culture, Andrea Palladio, Alexander Girard, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Architectural Mythology.</p>
