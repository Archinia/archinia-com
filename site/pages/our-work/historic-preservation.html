<div class="inner style1">

<p>We are most known for our documentation and planning for the preservation of historic buildings and landscapes. We have worked with BLM, USFS, and NPS, as well as State and Tribal Historic Preservation Officers in 10 states, completing building documentation inventories on over 700 structures and sites, including National Register and National Landmark properties. Our projects have involved as many as 100 stakeholders and we have integrated the efforts of interns as well as volunteers, which helps us to elevate our projects to community-impacting educational opportunities.</p>

<p>Our inclusive approach has allowed us to develop pioneering interdisciplinary research in: revisiting historic precedents to get past style and into the design's substance, as well as preserving context in historic structures, trails, sites, landscapes, and monuments.</p>
