<div class="inner style1">

<p>I am most known for my collaborative approach to documentation and planning for the preservation of historic buildings and landscapes. I have worked with BLM, USFS, and NPS, as well as State and Tribal Historic Preservation Officers in 10 states, completing building documentation inventories on over 700 structures and sites, including State and National Register as well as National Landmark properties. Projects have involved as many as 100 stakeholders and my teams have integrated the efforts of interns as well as volunteers, which helps elevate projects to community-impacting educational opportunities.</p>
<p>This inclusive approach has allowed my teams to develop pioneering interdisciplinary research in: revisiting historic precedents to get past style and into the design's substance, as well as preserving context in historic structures, trails, sites, landscapes, and monuments. My work has been nominated for the prestigous Peterson Prize for historic building documentation.</p>
