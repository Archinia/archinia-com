<p>New Mexico. Land of Enchantment. Land of many cultures. Land of confusing directions. She’s mysterious… so much so, that she can also be confusing. You don’t want to have to do hours of research to plan the perfect getaway. You just want to know where to go and what to do. As a travel writer and architectural historian, I have learned much about the hidden gems in New Mexico. I can help you finesse your plans, or even come along for the ride, and help you make the most of your itinerary. Do you want to see all of Alexander Girard’s work here? Make sacred pilgrimages to mysterious shrines? Explore our architectural treasures?</p>
<p>I’ve done tours for the Leaders of Design Council, Museum Design Summit, Yelp, Museum of International Folk Art, Taos County Historical Society, Old Spanish Trail Association, and numerous groups in Santa Fe and Taos. </p>
<p>In addition to my work in New Mexico, I have designed architecture tours of Okinawa Japan, Charleston, San Francsisco, and Savannah. </p>
<p>New custom step-on tours, coming soon!</p>
