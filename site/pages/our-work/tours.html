<p>New Mexico. Land of Enchantment. Land of many cultures.  Land of confusing directions. She’s mysterious… so much so, that she can also be confusing. You don’t want to have to do hours of research to plan the perfect getaway. You just want to know where to go and what to do. As a travel writer and architectural historian, I have learned much about the hidden gems in New Mexico. I can help you finesse your plans, or even come along for the ride, and help you make the most of your itinerary. Do you want to see all of Alexander Girard’s work here? Make sacred pilgrimages to mysterious shrines? Explore our architectural treasures?</p>

<p>I can help. <a href="mailto:intentiondesign@gmail.com?subject=Tour%20Help%20Request">Email me.</a></p>

<p>I’ve done tours for the Taos County Historical Society, The Old Spanish Trail Association, the Museum of International Folk Art, numerous groups in Santa Fe, done spiritual architecture tours of northern New Mexico, and others.</p>
