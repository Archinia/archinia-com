This is a checklist of the factors that may be involved in evaluating a site for construction. Information is usually collected only for those items that are pertinent to the project. We hope this will help you answer questions about what it is you really need and want for your home

## Overview of Design Requirements

Please describe the qualities of your building site that your designer should know about. Include likes and dislikes and any features that should be incorporated into the design.
