This is a checklist of the factors that may be involved in evaluating a site for construction. Information is usually collected only for those items that are pertinent to the project. We hope this will help you answer questions about what it is you really need and want for your home

Overview of Design Requirements



Please describe the qualities of your building site that your designer should know about. Include likes and dislikes and any features that should be incorporated into the design.



**Site Considerations**



Climate



_Prevailing winds_

 Direction

 Â  Maximum, minimum, and average velocities

 Special considerations (g., tornado, flood, hurricane-prone areas)



_Solar orientation_

 Sun angles

 Days of sunlight

 Cloud cover

 Shading of (or from) adjacent structures, natural features, and vegetation



_Temperature_

 Variation

 Maximums and minimums for various times of year



_Humidity_

 Variation

 Maximums and minimums for various times of year

_Precipitation_



 Peak period total

 Annual and seasonal total



Topography

_Surface drainage_

 Location of streams and washes

 Proximity to floodplains

 Maximum flood levels

 Frequently flooded areas

 Local watershed areas, amount of runoff collected, and location of outfalls

 Swampy and concave areas without drainage

 Other obstacles that may interrupt or obstruct natural surface drainage
