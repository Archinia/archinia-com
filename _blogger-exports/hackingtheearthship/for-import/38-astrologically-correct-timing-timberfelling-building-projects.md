We know how the moon affects tides here on earth… when the moon is full, the tides are highest, and when the moon is new, the tides are lowest. Well, the same gravitational pull between our planet and her orb pulls water up not only into the atmosphere, but into our bodies, the trunks of trees, the leaves of plants, and even into solid rock!

It was once common knowledge that if you wanted lumber to last, you harvested the wood on certain days. Or if you wanted your firewood to burn as long as possible, you would harvest that on certain days too. There is a great book called [Moon Time – The Art of Harmony with Nature and Lunar Cycles](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1844133001/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1844133001&linkCode=as2&tag=archinia-20&linkId=FUVNVPNT2LI6IITC) by Johanna Paungger and Thomas Poppe which goes into many chapters worth of detail about these traditional ways of building. But allow us to offer a brief overview here so you can determine whether you might want to use correct timing to fell your wood and build your home. We will not get into all the “whys” - you can grab the book if you would like to know the details! We will at least give you the “whens”!

For me, the biggest benefit of connecting buildings to the movements of the planets is more about connecting to the cosmos than it is about astrology or right timing. The functional benefits are a perk of setting my intentions!

The moon is waning after the full moon and before the new moon. The moon is waxing after the new moon and before the full moon. As with everything, the ideal wood cutting astrology dates may vary slightly by region. Check to see if your area has its own criteria.
