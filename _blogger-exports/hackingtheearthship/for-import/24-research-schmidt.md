_Ann Schmidt_  
Earthship Biotectures: Experimental Subdivision in Taos, New Mexico: The Greater World Earthship Community. Sustainability and the Built Environment Class Report. 2006.  

Conclusions:  

_“There are many questions I have after investigating the Greater World Earthship Community. There is no doubt that the Earthship exceeds the general expectation of a sustainable building, but the greater world community does not meet the criteria described as smart growth. Dwellings are arranged too far apart. Individually owned cars are still the main source of transportation. Currently, the nearest retail center is twelve miles away. Residents of this community must either telecommute for work, or drive to places of employment. How could this community be modified to increase densities without compromising the way an Earthship works? Further, would a developer take on the task of the labor intensive rammed earth tire?”_
