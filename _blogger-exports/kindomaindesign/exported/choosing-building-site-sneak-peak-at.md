Oftentimes, the land is one of the least relevant features of a building. You get to choose between  property you have… or property you can afford. Sometimes though, that’s not enough. In those cases, the selection of the site can allow you to dream far bigger than you ever thought possible. Your real estate agent knows what generic home or land buyer X wants, and they know how to answer these questions:  

**Site Selection Conventional Criteria**

  
  

_Beauty_

Views

Trees

_Quality of Life_

Neighbors

Proximity to Police, Fire, & Medicine

Schools

Shopping

Recreation

_Investment_

Property Values

Security

Taxes

_Design_

Codes and Covenants

Gas, Water, Sewer, Power

Roads & Transportation

Slope & drainage

  

These get to the meat of things. But what about the HEART of things? What’s missing? In Japan, every landscape is designed to play host to the god(s). There are mountains, valleys, waterfalls, streams, and abundant plants, especially flowering ones, which can delight the senses. There’s something to this practice, and when combined with an attention to ecology and relationship, they create a way of seeing the site of your new home in an entirely new way. 

How about adding these criteria to help you design the perfect space?
