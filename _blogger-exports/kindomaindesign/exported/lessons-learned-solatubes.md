For those of you who might want to install solatubes in your old or new home, let me give you some feedback on what we have learned about them.  
Using them in all public spaces is wonderful. Baths, kitchen, living room, and especially closets... all can benefit from these devices. We love solatubes with "warm effects" lenses which make the light less fluorescent appearing.  
When installing in media rooms (anywhere there is a TV), dining rooms or bedrooms where you might want to be able to control the light levels, it is best to do one of a few things: install solatubes with a daylight dimmer. This single design consideration can make a huge difference in how much you love your solatube's capability to deliver great natural light!
