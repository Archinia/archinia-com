Today is about connections. I'm trying to let you all know I am here trying to help!  
  
First on my agenda for writing will be about the 4 climate zones, then the 8 cultural vernacular zones in the US. Vernacular zones are composed of the climate zone plus the traditions that grew out of a cultural response to the environment.  
  
So, for instance - Vail, Colorado, which is in the Cool Climate Zone, is also in an Alpine Vernacular zone becuase it was influenced by European settlers and has a great deal of snow. Thus the building's response to the environment, and therefore it's shape and orientation - are not even slightly similar to somewhere like Seattle, which is also in a Cool Climate Zone.  
  
So, as I get done with my morning chores around the ranch, I'll start writing about climate zines. Then vernacular zones. Hopefully by the end of this week I'll have a complete picture laid out for you.  
  
_Remember that I'm writing a book on the subject, The Illustrated Guide to Building Design for Kin Domains, due out in February, which will go onto a LOT more detail and give you checklists to make the design of your kin domains as easy as possible. Let's work together to change the world, one kin domain at a time!_ Brightest blessings!
