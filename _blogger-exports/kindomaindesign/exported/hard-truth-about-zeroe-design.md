According to the US Department of Energy, a Zero Energy Home (ZEH) combines state-of-the-art, energy-efficient construction with renewable energy, such as solar water heating and solar electricity. It also uses Energy-Star rated appliances. While this sounds like a GREAT plan, and is, in theory… in practice, well, it’s just too dependent on “the illusion” of the world being exactly as it appears to be.

  

Technology is not the answer to all of society’s ills. While improving medical care and providing access to all kinds of information that we never had access to before, it actually ignores space and time and place. It allows us to use non-sustainable methods to make ourselves feel better about how much we take, while still taking. It uses products that are recycled and recyclable. That’s great. But why not use materials that decompose so there is no aftereffect? No shipping cost? That encourage sweat equity in lieu of buying your way into feeling green?

  

We can use products that minimize our dependence on cement, which causes 10% of the WORLD’s carbon dioxide emissions. We can harvest stone right off the ground. We can use adobe formed earth instead of plastic bags of earth.  We can stop putting metal over our doors and windows. Superinsulation is great. Earth insulation is better. We can keep rigid foam insulation, which is made from petrochemicals and often used for superinsulated roofs, out of out buildings.

  

The average cost for super insulation, PV and high-efficiency furnaces and windows as required by Zero-E is about $30,000 (US) as of 2009.  Ducts are made of metal, which must be mined, morphed, and shipped. The windows and doors have toxic gases in them to make them perform better. Solar PV uses more aluminum than metal in a new car. All these systems require some source of power to operate. Zero-E homes require a backup – you have to be connected to the grid. If you are connected to the grid, chances are you have to have electrical outlets every 7’ as required by code. Why live like that if you don’t want to?

  

I have a favorite story about technology and how much it helps people who truly live off the grid. A group of people that I love to support gave a reverse osmosis water system to a small school in South America so that the school could clean the rainwater it was already harvesting, make potable water, and sell it to their neighbors. It was SO cool and it worked! They made money for their programs and got new books and uniforms. Then one of the lines got a tiny crack in it. The system uses plastic parts. Plastic parts not available in the area and not patchable my any means they have access to. Now, the school has a very interesting piece of wall art that even if they could afford to fix, they couldn’t find anyone with the technical know-how or tools to repair. How’s that for “helping”? Technology is not always the answer. And it fails. Good design doesn't fail. It may not be perfect, but its a good place to start.

  

We can do better that that. And we can start now.
