So we've started looking at the way ALL architecture responds to different forces –

time, space, views, community, family, ego, the environment...

Seeing how we have built before tells us about the values of the people.

All architecture responds to these forces.

The question is… how does it where you are?

And has that changed over time or are the old responses still valid?
