So, one of my favorite pasttimes is breaking down walls. I've been asked a thousand times what plants grow well inside earthships, and despite repeated attempts at asking the so-called "experts," I could not get them to offer what was successful. So I started asking people who lived in them. This is the resulting list. I hope this helps!
