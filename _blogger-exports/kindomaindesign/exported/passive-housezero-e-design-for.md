So one of the troubles that we have with green design in the US right now is that it is wholly dependent on technology. Solar panels, radiant heat, low-e windows - all require massive inputs of technology and materials to produce.  
  
One of the most interesting concepts we are using in the design of our _modernist\*_ kin domains today is called the Passive House, a concept introduced from Germany most recently (1996) and based on passive solar design, which is older than any nation you've ever heard of. In this technique, rather than depend on materials (because in our new way of thinking those are pre-determined by what you have around you), we pay close attention to two things: air infiltration and total energy consumption. This instantly rewards the owner with up to 50% energy savings annually.  
  
To accomplish this, we:  

*   Super-insulate the home and roof with a minimum of 12 inches of insulation, and more if its a cold or hot area.
*   Minimize heating and cooling loads (your computer can help heat a cold room!)
*   Reduce the size and number of north facing windows, except in studio environments
*   Align the structure to the sun's most beneficial path
*   Minimize the size of the structure to reduce surface area exposed to the elements and so that heat can get from one side to the other
*   Provide summer shading so that spaces in the south and west do not get overheated, usually using a combination of shade devices, trees, pergolas, vertical gardens, or green roofs.
*   Medium toned finishes on exterior walls and roofs in temperate zones, light in hot areas. Dark tones are reserved for always cold areas.
*   Maximize natural ventilation, and provide shade and trees around the structure to clean and cool the air before it comes in.
*   Daylighting techniques are used, by adding tube skylights and reflector surfaces on windows

  
These houses can cost up to 15% more than a traditional house to construct, however, the cost is usually made up within a few years in energy savings.  
  
You might not have the aversion to unnatural materials that many of our current clients have, and if so, this technique may be perfect for you! Hope this helps!  
  
\*_traditionalist_ kin domains are constructed of local materials and never use modern (read: unnatural and manufactured) materials, though either type may be modern or traditional in appearance.  
  
To be fair, our firm is more traditionalist than pro Zero-E. We outline our position on this matter in the blogpost [The Hard Truth about Zero E Design](http://kindomains.archinia.com/2011/01/hard-truth-about-zeroe-design.html)
