When designing a kin domain or a residence, it is often overlooked that the space represents its place – the home is a microcosmic connection to the macrocosmic world, and reflects your relationship with both the inner and outer dimensions. Interior and Exterior can be used to fuse your ideals to your space. With that in mind, I offer a way of looking at the spaces of architecture through the lens of Spirit. What divine guidance does this inspire in you?

Think about what each of these spaces mean to you, and work with what you discover to manifest your ideal oasis for each purpose. When you create your spaces in this way, they are more responsive, even alive… they become trained to you, and you and the space begin to “breathe” together. This gives architecture that inherently “right” feeling. Then surround yourself with things you love. If it doesn’t serve love, throw it away. And watch what happens.
