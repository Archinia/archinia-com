Collecting and transforming matter into usable materials for new buildings is the biggest part of the embodied energy equation for building. Re-invigorating well-built existing buildings is one way you can make a real difference. You won't use nearly as many new resources, and you can save a great deal of money. In new construction, the cost split between labor and materials is about 50-50; in renovation it is about 75% labor and 25% materials, and right now there are a lot of construction workers without jobs. So, you can do your part to save the world by staying right where you are, or close by, in a great old house that you can make shine... and save yourself quite a lot of money in the process.
