I designed my friend Dan a house recently. This is a quick, one day design based on the earthship concept but entirely different too.  
The entrance to the house is through a patio garden on the southwest (front) of the kitchen. The entrance features a distinctive gate set into garden walls and extra layers of shading on the portal to encourage summer dining on the patio. To the side of this garden is a small pathway which passes in front of the central greenhouse and its forward coldframe to a private outdoor deck for the master bedroom. The vertical-wall greenhouse DOES NOT OPEN TO THE HOUSE! Instead, it has a black hot water wall between the house and the the greenhouse (not visible from the living area) with windows above.

I bermed the north side 4' so I could bury water catchments and have constant temperatures there, and  built what appears to be a sunken patio (but is in fact on the same level plane as the rest of the house) on the north central section and framed views with a built-in bench and fireplace. I also drained that area so I could capture the most amount of snow possible for the catchment system.  
The kitchen has a large storage area (8'x15') on the north side (also for the great temps and humidity) with small high windows above and to the outside for ventilation and natural light. The kitchen is open, with an island prep area that could also house the stove or sink depending on preference. The built-in breakfast area can also serve as a desk or a dining room table, with comfortable seating for 6.  
The living room is entirely open with a fireplace. On either side of the fireplace are built-in bookshelves. The bedroom on the east has its own patio, which could easily be made totally private with the installation of a partial-height garden wall. It would also be a good place to add a outdoor shower. The bed is inset into a bay window so that nightstands are built-in with bookshelves to the sides and windows above. The fireplace in the bedroom is in front of the bed, also with bookshelves on either side. A large closet opens at a 45 degree angle to the north, as does the bathroom which could be elevated if needed for ease of installation of the cistern. There is a small patio outside this bath as well. An open shower allows this space to connect to the outdoors yet again, and since it is in the northeast with the graywater, catchment and cistern systems (below) minimizes the amount of plumbing required.  
The house has a green roof planted with desert plants which reaches all the way down to the bermed area on the north, so the planted roof can be seemless with the ground, hopefully encouraging natural use of the structure by animals and insects, and the intermingling of plants as they seed. It is entirely feasible to add a earth-cooled ductwork system for natural cooling behind this wall.  
As you may be able to see, I believe in creating spaces that can be opened up to be literally inside/outside at the same time, but that are totally naturally lit and ventillated too. I want, even in the throes of winter, to be warm, and to feel like I am one with the world around me. At Archinia, we find our greatest happiness when multiple utilities can be served by one material or design philosophy...  
Thanks for checking this out. I hope this inspires you to create YOUR perfect oasis!!
