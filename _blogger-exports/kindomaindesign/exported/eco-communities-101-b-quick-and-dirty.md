_PLANETARY AWARENESS/ SUSTAINABILITY_

  

Sustainability means _"a continuing process of economic and social development… that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."_ \[Global Tomorrow Coalition\]

  

Easy things to implement to create a better community from the outset are guidelines which include:

  

SUSTAINABLE ENERGY AND WATER

· Passive solar design

· Greenhouses

· Solar hot-water systems

· Sky-lights

· Wall mirrors

· Fresh air ventilation

· Low energy-use appliances

· Low-flush toilets, sinks, and shower heads

· Grey water use

· Rain collecting systems

  

SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

· Community agriculture

· Minimal road structure

· Berms and swales to collect and control the flow of rainwater

· Edible landscaping over ego landscaping (landscaping not just because it is pretty)

· Community Gardens minimize the negative impact on native vegetation and critters who like to enjoy it, as well as minimizes the infrastructure required to make the gardens grow.

  

RECYCLING & RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

· Household materials

· Water purification and recirculation

· Composting

  

DESIGN

· Clustered housing

· Shared gardens

· Multi-use community spaces

· Community Offices and Workshops

· **_Village Center / Town Square where outsiders can come visit, trade, learn, etc._**

  

  
**_    LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION_**

  

The single most important factor of community building, and the one that most often gets overlooked, is LOCATION. Many people find land for cheap and they get all atwitter about buying it and turning it into something. The problem with this is: reality. Bad land is the LAST place you want to build a community if you are starting from scratch and want to be able to function off the grid. What you want to look for are the same things the people that settled the land 10,000 years ago looked for: 

  

· flowing water

· security

· variety of vegetation

· minimal environmental concerns (floods, massive snow, etc)

· good access to sun (never ever build on the north side of a mountain in a place where it snows)

· access to over 50 inches of rainfall (that hits the ground ) annually

· intersection of two ecosystems

o The VERY best combination:

+ riparian: (**at least** one stream and one river) for water & vegetation for herd animals

+ wooded: for trees for the buildings, for security, and for hunting and gathering
