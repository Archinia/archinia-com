How To Reduce Your Energy Bills / Energy Conservation Begins at Home  
  
Imagine leaving a window open all winter long -- the heat loss, cold drafts and wasted energy! If your home has a folding attic stair, a whole house fan or AC Return, a fireplace or a clothes dryer, that may be just what is occurring in your home every day.  
  
These often overlooked sources of energy loss and air leakage can cause heat and AC to pour out and the outside air to rush in -- costing you higher energy bills.  
  
But what can you do about the four largest “holes” in your home -- the folding attic stair, the whole house fan or AC return, the fireplace, and the clothes dryer?

I am not endorsing this product as I cannot attest to it's cost, green character, ease of installation, or warranty.  
However, supporting ideas and information regarding insulating attic access is included in the book, and a very good place to plug up holes... therefore I am going to allow a well intentioned marketing comment here.
