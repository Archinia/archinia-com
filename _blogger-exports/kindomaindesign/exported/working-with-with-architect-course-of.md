Schematic Design – Develop a Building Program and Masterplan  
  
A Building Program establishes the sizes and uses of areas required to meet your needs. This document provides two major benefits – it gives the Architect a guideline to design by - so that the end result reflects the need, and it assists the organization itself in laying out and understanding it’s ideals. As the program is developed, the organization can check itself against its purpose, realign itself to that purpose if required, and evaluate its functionality.  
  
The end result of programming should include:  
  
\- Organization Mission Statement  
\- List of Goals  
\- List of Needs  
\- Information about the property  
\- Budget  
\- Specific requirements of different program areas, i.e. education, accessibility, administration  
  
Sometimes, when there are many buildings, or many phases required, a Masterplan is ideal. This document specifically addresses site and surrounding area, in a level of detail far beyond the scope of a Building Program. The exact size and shape of the building is not necessary at this time. A Masterplan allows the building and planning committees an opportunity to see the functional relationships between different aspects of a building, identify phasing requirements, as well as identify relationships between inside and outside space. The Masterplan is expected to be a “living” document, not set in stone, as the program develops or future needs are changed, the Masterplan is changed. It should give a fairly accurate snapshot of the design ideas as they are idealized today.  
  
After these processes are completed, or alongside them, the Architect will prepare Schematic Design documents, which will include conceptual plans and elevations for the building and site, as well as a conceptual cost estimate for the work.  
  
The cost for completing Schematic Design Documents is usually about 15% of the Architects’ total budget. (Masterplanning and Building Programming are separate services.)  
  
  
Design Development - Finesse the Design  
  
After the organization approves the Schematic Design Documents, the Architect will prepare more detailed documents allowing for inclusion of technical criteria like mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and green design considerations, as well as outline specifications. An updated and much more clearly defined construction estimate is prepared.  
  
The cost for completing Design Development Documents is usually about 15% of the Architects’ total budget.  
  
  
Construction Documents – Prepare Documents for Contractors  
  
After the organization approves the Design Development Documents, the Architect will prepare working drawings, which will elaborate each dimension and detail for the Contractors to use for construction.  
  
The cost for completing Construction Documents is usually about 40% of the Architects’ total budget.  
  
  
Bidding and Negotiation – Choosing a Contractor  
  
Your Architect will submit, on your behalf, the plans to the city or county building officials for permit review. Alongside the process, the projects will be announced to interested builders. This process can happen in many ways, and your Architect can assist you in determining which method is right for your organization. The result of this phase is a Contractual Agreement with your preferred Contractor. To be clear – you have a Contractual relationship with your Architect(s), and with your Contractor, separately. Your Architect and Contractor do not have ANY legal relationship other than a desire to get your project built to the design standard you select.  
  
The cost for completing Bidding and Negotiation is usually about 10% of the Architects’ total budget.  
  
  
Construction Administration – Watch the Building Grow from the Ground Up!  
  
Construction Administration is the phase when the building goes from designs on paper to a tangible edifice rising above the land. The Architect and Contractor will work hard to ensure that the building result is an accurate refection of design intentions and program requirements. Your Architect will assist the Contractor with supplementary drawings, site visits to answer questions and document progress, review the Contractors pay Applications, prepare and authorize changes to the work (Change Orders), determine the date of substantial completion, prepare the final punchlist, and collect warranty data.  
  
The cost for completing Construction Administration is usually about 20% of the Architects’ total budget.
