In fact, the concept of a self-supporting farm is not a new idea at all. The concept of a agricultural _Villa_ has been around for thousands of years, though once it was reserved for only the richest families. Anastasia's vision has made the opportunity much more feasible for everyone.  
  
The Ten Books of Architecture was written in the first century BC by the Roman writer known as Vitruvius, whose real name was Marcus _Vitruvius_ Pollio. In it he gives this guidance:  
  
  
Winter dining and restrooms should be placed in the southwest, to take advantage of gentle warmth and good lighting in the times they are most used - in the evenings.  
  
Bedrooms, libraries, morning dining rooms, and spring and autumn dining rooms should be in the east, to enjoy the good light in the morning, relieve dampness, and provide comfortable temperatures.  
  
Summer dining, picture galleries, and painter's studios should be in the north, to take advantage of even lighting, and low heat.  
  
Residences should be built with a hierarchy of spaces. That means, there should be large public spaces that anyone may enter at the foreground (meaning towards the entrance), and more intimate private spaces removed from these (placed either behind or above) that are only accessible by invitation.  
  
Vitruvius gave very specialized directions pertaining to proportion systems too, however it does not seem appropriate here to try to fit a limited size house into a thousand year old vision which was unlimited except in imagination, and built and managed by servants... a luxury most of us cannot afford.
