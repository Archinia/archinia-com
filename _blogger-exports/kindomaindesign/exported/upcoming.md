In the next few weeks,Â  we'll be posting a step-by-step walkthrough of our newest kin domain design which was done in our workshop format.  
  
I'll also be posting some VERY big news pertaining to our research on archaeological models and using them for modern design.  
  
I'm traveling until May 23, but expect to hear updates soon thereafter!
