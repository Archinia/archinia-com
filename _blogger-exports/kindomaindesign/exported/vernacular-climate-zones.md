Before designing a building in any location, it is valuable to understand the traditional responses that have informed the response of historic structures in that environment. That is: It’s vernacular – it’s place and time. Vernacular architecture is part history, part culture, and part coming to understand local materials and methods.  

To really “get” it, you have to look well into the local past: to buildings constructed before 1940, unless the building is high end (expensive). Because by the end of the second world war, resources were depleted and the industrial revolution had encouraged a building society of “efficiently designed” boxes for easy construction.

Before the Wars, buildings were built without regard for mechanical heating and cooling. Most were designed without considering the use of electricity. They were designed to let in the maximum amount of natural light possible while minimizing the impacts of heat and cold on the building. Some were designed for fire protection, some were designed to brace the building against high winds and deep snow. Or they were designed with minimal windows and doors and deep walls to maximize the coolness, as in the desert. They were all designed by a people from somewhere “else” and those cultural building components came with them. However, over time, some of the cultural traditions fell away in favor of more environmentally responsive solutions.

The following are each of the vernacular zones. I'll outline each zone in a free ebook I will offer on my archinia.com website, hopefully in the next week!
