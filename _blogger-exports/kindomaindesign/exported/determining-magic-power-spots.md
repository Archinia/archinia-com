Are you one of those people who wants to give spirit a place to reside on your land? If so, use these techniques to find the “juiciest” spots to build, create, or manifest!

  

*   Allow everything else to disappear. Just be still on the land you are dowsing.
*   Then, when you have plenty of time, just…. walk.
*   In several locations, you are likely to develop a strange affinity with the land.
*   The response you have may be positive or negative in connotation. Don’t mind that.
*   Just mark these spots.
*   Go back to these spots every day for three days and spend a minimum of ½ hour in them. Some will fall away and you can redistribute their marker to the land.
*   One or two will become power spots for you. You’ll know because these spots will be the ones you immediately find yourself drawn to.
*   This is a sacred center. Mark this place and bring your intentions here.
*   Plant a tree, place a bench, hang a hammock, or put the center stone of your labyrinth here.
