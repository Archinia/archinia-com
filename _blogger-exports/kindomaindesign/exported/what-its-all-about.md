We design Kin Domains on a set of principles we feel is in keeping with the Kin Domain movement. For those of you eagerly expecting the book release (which is now going to occur in English, French and Spanish!), here's a little taste of what's to come. The book will guide you through all of these aspects, and even help you to design the perfect house for your family!  
  
  
Bioclimatic sustainable design is informed by a region’s specific environmental and cultural characteristics, and:  
  

*   Generates its own energy with renewable resources
*   Captures and treats its water onsite
*   Uses resources efficiently
*   Embraces cultural standards for beauty

  
Conscientious Site Selection  
Avoids building: Within 50-feet of Wetlands; on or adjacent to sensitive ecological habitats such as primary dunes, old growth forest, or virgin prairie; prime farmland; or within the 100-year flood plain  
  
Making space for Habitat  
For each foot of development, another foot is set aside, as a habitat exchange for plants and animals.  
  
Net Zero Energy  
The building’s energy needs are supplied by on-site renewable energy sources - sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and/or geothermal heat.  
  
Materials To Avoid  
The building design does not use products which include toxic materials, including: Formaldehyde, Halogenated Flame Retardants, PVC, Mercury, CFC’s, HCFC’s, Neoprene (chloroprene), Cadmium, Chlorinated Polyethylene and Chlorosulfonated Polyethlene, Wood treatments containing Creosote, Arsenic or Pentachlorophenol, Polyurethane, Lead, Phthalates  
  
Supporting Responsible Industry  
All wood used in the project is FSC certified or from salvaged sources.  
  
Supporting Local Manufacturing and Minimizing Transport Cost and Impact  
Locally harvested and manufactured materials and services supports the local economy and minimizes cost and impact of transportation. We endeavor to use consultants and materials located within a 500 miles radius of the project and / or project administrators.  
  
Minimization of Construction Waste  
Construction waste, in current markets, accounts for the production of 3.9 pounds of waste per square foot of building. To minimize the impact of building projects, we aim to reduce this by conscientiously recycling: Metals; Paper and Cardboard; Soil, and biomass; Rigid Foam, carpet & insulation; Asphalt; Concrete and concrete blocks; Brick; tile and masonry materials; Untreated lumber; Plywood, OSB and particle board; Gypsum wallboard scrap; Glass; Plumbing fixtures; Windows; Doors; Cabinets; Architectural fixtures; Millwork, paneling and similar; Electric fixtures, motors, switch gear and similar; and HVAC equipment, duct work, control systems, switches  
  
Net Zero Water / Sustainable Water Discharge  
Water is harnessed through captured precipitation or reuse. Water that is purified is made so without the use of chemicals. Storm water and building water discharge is handled on-site, utilizing techniques such as trees, green roofs, and plant boxes.  
  
Living and Livable Spaces  
Operable windows are included in each space and natural daylighting is included in the design.  
Entryways have an external dirt track-in system and an internal one contained within an entry vestibule.  
Kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms, garages, copy rooms, janitorial closets, and chemical storage spaces are separately ventilated.  
Interior finishes are low-VOC, zero-VOC, recycled, or natural.  
  
Beauty and Spirit, and Outward Impact  
The building contains design features intended solely for delight and the celebration of culture, spirit and place.  
Educational materials about the performance and operation of the public portions of the project are made available, in order to inspire and educate.
