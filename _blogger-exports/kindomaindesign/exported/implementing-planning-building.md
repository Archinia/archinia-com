Planning and Building Committees are integral to the process of design for public spaces. Public spaces include an occupancy where there is a tendency for many people go gather for various reasons. This process is not necessary for residential construction.  
  
A building or planning committee represents your project both outward - representing your group's needs to the architect and builders, and inward – sharing design and budgeting to the administration and benefactors. The members of this committee, or these committees, are often very active in the organization, broad-minded, level headed clear thinkers. The perfect balance in these committees is found when there are both general thinkers – with a broad range of experience and exposure, and specialists - who can finesse aspects of the design so that the result is a finer representation of the need. It is vital that building and planning committees have at least one member, preferably their chairperson, with a strong business and accounting sensibility. There are going to be large cost considerations in any project and it is vital that someone understand and be able to explain how the funding is obtained and distributed. A committee of 5-7 is ideal in size, for schedule coordination and cohesiveness. A secretary should document all decisions.  
  
The planning committee should, before the process of design even begins, obtain:  
\-A site survey that documents boundaries, topography, locations of trees over 6” in diameter, adjoining buildings, streets and curbs, building setbacks, easements, and the location of utilities.  
\-Zoning restrictions for the site  
\-Deed restrictions  
\-Drawings of existing facilities, if applicable  
  
**Planning Committee Do’s and Don’ts**  
  
_Do_\-Express your concerns to the Architect  
\-Ask questions of the Architect  
\-Alert the Architect if something appears to be wrong  
\-Expedite payments to Architect and Contractor  
  
_Don’t_  
\-Give the Contractor instructions – Communicate via the Chairperson to your Architect who will them work with Contractor  
\-Allow members of the organization to perform construction unless they competitively bid for the work. Consult with your Architect.  
\-Make unnecessary changes.
