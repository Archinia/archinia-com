One of my recent google search results noted that someone was looking for the best trees to plant for a living fence. My favorite tree for this purpose, if you want real privacy, is arborvitae, or 'cemetery trees'. They can handle many kinds of weather, are evergreen, and will provide a wall of privacy if you want something over 7' tall. For lower fences, I advocate for roses and berries, for the animals who will love to nibble them!
