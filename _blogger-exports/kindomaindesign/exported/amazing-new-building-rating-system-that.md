When I was getting a LEED technology update in a conference today, I found out about a GREAT new building rating system that works WAY better than LEED for Kins Domains!  
Its called the  
**_Living Building Challenge_**  
and it evaluates building performance in 7 areas:  
Site, Water, Energy, Health, Materials, Equity and Beauty!  
Please consider using this as a means to help you make decisions about your eco-settlement or Kins Domain!
