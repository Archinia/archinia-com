This is some of the beautiful decorative plaster work from the [Natural Homes website](http://www.naturalhomes.org/timeline/athena-steen.htm) by Bill and Athena Steen of the [Canelo Project](http://www.caneloproject.com/). This design is made by plastering the wall in several layers of different clays or with different pigments. The design is then made by cutting and removing the various layers to reveal their contrasting colours. This particular wall, in Slovakia, was plastered on one of their European tours when they take the opportunity to share their design and clay skills.
