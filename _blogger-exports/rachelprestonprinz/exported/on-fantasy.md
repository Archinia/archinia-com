Fantasy doesn't just have to be the pseudo-porn of peers running their weekly D&D game in their (or more likely, their mom's...) basement. It's a healthy way of being in the world. Imagination is what gave us quantum physics, everything we've ever seen under a microscope, and even Disney movies.  
  
Maggie MacNab, in her book Design by Nature, reminds us that:  
  
**_"Fantasy is a dominant characteristic of creative flow because it generates more than one idea. When you are in the midst of the creative process, make a note of all your ideas, even the ones that don't appear important."_**  
  
Better keep that sketchbook handy!
