The Killer Heels exhibit at the ABQ Museum wasn't a huge draw for me, since I don't even wear heels... or shoes... (or clothes)... if I can get away with it. I wasn't even vaguely interested until EVERYONE I KNEW started talking about what a great exhibit it was. So, last week, hubby and I went. It was SO worth it. We ended up spending nearly two hours in the exhibit. I never thought shoes could be so interesting!  
  
The one thing I will say about the short films they commissioned for this exhibit... Watch yourself first before you let children watch them. Some of them are borderline porn and trend toward violent. Cool for adults. Not so much for kids... methinks.  
  
But get thee to the Museum!!! This is a great exhibit and it closes 8-8!
