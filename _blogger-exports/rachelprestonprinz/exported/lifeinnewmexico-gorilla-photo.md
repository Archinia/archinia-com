The gorillas at the Biopark are such extraordinary creatures. More than once, I've sat myself down at the viewing glass, been patient, and had one finally amble over to me and spend some time just sitting together, looking at one another. I love the Biopark. It connects me with the beauty of nature and with the spirits of these beautiful creatures we share this planet with. Though I hate any creature to be in a cage, I want them to live happy, healthy lives. And I think they do here. Thanks guys for all you do for these furry beings. â™¥
