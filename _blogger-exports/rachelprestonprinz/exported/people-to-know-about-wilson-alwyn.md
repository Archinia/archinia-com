Wilson Alwyn "Snowflake" Bentley (1865 â€“ 1931) was born in Jericho, Vermont. He is one of the first known photographers of the microscopic details of snowflakes.

He was incredibly attuned to this task, and spent years perfecting his art - he had precious few seconds to capture that snowflake - which was wholly individual and would never be repeated in nature - before it disappeared forever. His dedication to his purpose was incredible. As was the result. The lesson of snowflakes could be that each structure responds to an exact and specific set of criteria, and that those criteria, as minute as they might be, are always present and accounted for in the snowflake's structure.  
  
What lesson is this to architecture? Could it be to make each space respond to its very unique environment, and therefore tell something of its story? Perhaps!
