[![Chef's Table](http://cdn7.nflximg.net/images/7117/20977117.jpg)](http://www.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=80007950&trkid=13078940)I want to encourage sustainability-minded people to watch the second episode of Chef's Table. It's available on Netflix streaming. It may well change the way you look at sustainability.  
  
It seemed like such a great idea.. sustainable food. What Chef Barber discovered is what all people who want to live truly sustainably discover: you have to approach every aspect of the ecosystem in order to get to true Sustainability. In architecture, that means you look at the land, the air, the water, the sun... even the plants you surround your space with. This episode continues the rich tradition of sotrytelling that @netflix started with this series. The visuals, food, and story are intriguing. What we can learn from this about achieving real (maybe even radical) sustainability is powerful.
