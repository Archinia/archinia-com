Rachel Preston Prinz is an architecturally-trained American designer, preservationist, documentary filmmaker, and artist working in sustainability and architectural engagement. She graduated with a Masters of Architecture and Certificate in Preservation from Texas A&M in 1998. After working in traditional architectural firms for more than 10 years, Rachel started Archinia in 2007 so that she could live her dream of promoting the craft of architecture and the Genius Loci, or Spirit of Place, especially pertaining to U.S. Southern, Mountain, and Southwest indigenous, vernacular, and modern design.  
  
Despite having gone partially blind, Rachel has served as a preservation commissioner in Taos, as the host of the UNM-Taos Sustainability Institute, and as co-host of TEDxABQWomen. She has won the Echoing Green Work on Purpose challenge and has been named a Green Guardian. Rachel has given multiple TEDx and Pecha Kucha talks on modern applications of vernacular design and critical regionalism, landscape preservation, pattern languages, and photography and Epicureanism. She has given presentations, tours, and lectures and written nearly a hundred articles integrating archaeology, architecture, place, culture, and emerging trends in sustainability.  
  
In 2016, Rachel was named one of Albuquerque Business First magazine's 30 "Women of Influence". She was also invited into the "Emerging Social Sector Leaders" cohort at the Santa Fe Community Foundation for her groundbreaking work promoting the craft of architecture through her hybrid firm comprised of the for-profit organization Archinia and the non-profit Architecture for EveryBody. Rachel's preservation and sustainability work has been featured on HGTV’s “You Live in WHAT?”; Bravo's "Untying the Knot"; NMPBS’ “Colores!”; “Home made” on Canadian PBS; and she’s been a featured guest on radio and television, including CBS Radio Women’s Media Center live with Robin Morgan, Women’s Focus, New Mexico PBS, PBS, CBS, Good Morning Vail, and KUNM. An emerging leader in the field of sustainability, Rachel’s been written about in Prime Your Mind For Confidence; Bermuda Quest; The Girls Guide To Swagger; and Accessing Intuition: Stories from Architects and Designers.
