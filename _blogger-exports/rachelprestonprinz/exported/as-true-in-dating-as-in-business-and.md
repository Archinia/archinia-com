__Great Quote__  
__from [http://markmanson.net/fuck-yes](http://markmanson.net/fuck-yes)__  
  
  
_**"**Remember, it’s your job to look for something cool in everyone you meet; it’s not their job to show you. This is life, not a fucking sales convention. Learning to appreciate people you meet is a skill you cultivate. So [get on it](http://markmanson.net/connection). This doesn’t mean you have to fall in love with everyone who breathes in your direction. It just means you need to take responsibility for your ability to connect with the people you are meeting."_
