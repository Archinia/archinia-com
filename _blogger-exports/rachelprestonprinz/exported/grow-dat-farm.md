At [Grow Dat Farm](http://app.streamsend.com/private/qZQR/Oc9/VvJbGRi/browse/16450219#ss-video_2609) in New Orleans, Louisiana, people from different backgrounds and disciplines come together in research and practice to support public health, local economies and a sustainable food system. The farm mission is to nurture aÂ diverse group of young leaders and provide job training through the meaningful work of growing food. It involves at-risk high school student crew members who learn to plant, harvest and cook as well as participate in leadership training classes. Social, economic and environmental issues addressed through this collaborative design project include poverty reduction, youth empowerment, employment, obesity, good health and green gardening. EPIC!
