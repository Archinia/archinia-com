We are always a little suspicious when someone starts talking smack about how green their building is... especially when its over 2,000sf. These homeowners though, [got totally hosed](http://realestate.aol.com/blog/2013/02/06/pavilion-gardens-eco-friendly-homes-energy-bill/?ncid=webmail42). Don't let it happen to you. LEED does not guarantee ANYTHING in actual performance - it only says you had good intentions.
