I feel blessed to have helped the State Department welcome preservation professionals from around the world to America so we can share ideas. One of them, Issam Hajjar, from Syria... does for Syria a grander version of what I try and do for New Mexico. Here's a [link](https://www.facebook.com/Issam.Hajjar.Photography) to his work!!! We hope you will enjoy these connections as much as we do!!
