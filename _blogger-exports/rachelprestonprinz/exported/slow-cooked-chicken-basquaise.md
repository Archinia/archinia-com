My in-laws were here a week ago and I prepared this dish to stew while we were out hiking, so it would be ready to eat when we got home. It's such an easy dish and I know many people are looking for something new - and delish! -  to tempt their taste buds. They and my MIL asked for the recipe, and I thought I'd share it here with you too.  
  
Usually, Basque people do not add potatoes and carrots to this dish. But I do, because my body doesn't seem to like meat sometimes anymore. And I love the taste of the veggies in this dish.

 Ingredients:  

- 1 tablespoon olive oil

- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves chopped
- 1 bunch green onions OR 1 whole onion, chopped
- 1 roasting chicken, or as in our case, a package of boneless chicken thighs
- 5 potatoes, diced in large chunks (or more, depending on your taste)
- 5 carrots, diced in large chunks (or more, depending on your taste)

- 1 (14.5 oz) can fire roasted tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 cup chicken broth
- a package of fresh herbs called "chicken seasoning" combining marjoram, thyme, sage and rosemary
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (or more if you are from New Mexico or India)
- salt and pepper to taste

### Preparation:

Heat olive oil in a large skillet; saute bacon or chorizo until browned. Set meat aside and use same pot. Add onions and garlic and saute til carmelized. Combine tomatoes, broth, spices and herbs and add to sauteed mixture while heating, scraping up browned bits from pan bottom. Place potatoes, carrots, and then chicken in slow cooker while that's warming through. Add meat to crock pot, then add sauteed mixture over chicken, meat, and veggies. Cover with peppers and olives.  Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours.  
  
Serves 4, with leftovers most times.
