dear golden ray of sunshine,  
most days  
I love you so much  
that I turn my back on you  
to turn on my camera  
and capture your twilight  
as it dances  
across some beautiful edifice  
whispering a silent story in twilight I long to tell  
  
today though  
my soul longs  
to feel you  
soaking into me  
so I ignore the camera  
and rush past and outside  
before I change my mind  
to sit at the foot of my temple  
and bask in you
