This past week was the BEST time! UNM-Taos brought in visionaries from around the world, including Bryan Bell - the founder of both SEED Network and Design Corps, Michael Reynolds of Earthship Biotecture, and Illac Diaz of Liters of Light. It was an opportunity for sustainability designers and advocates from around the world to come together with the express intent of sharing ideas and helping each other grow. I think it's an incredible step that UNM-Taos is making towards putting New Mexico on the map as a leading place in the world for Sustainability! We are, and we have been for more than 1000 years!  
  
I got to host the event, and it was an amazing experience!  
  
Here are some of my favorite moments~!
