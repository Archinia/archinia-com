This exquisite table top icon of Our Lady of Guadalupe is in a private collection I was lucky enough to get to see recently. It is the work of Father Damien, heiromonk, a canonical priest of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in the United States.

Another of his great works in New Mexico is the Last Supper, in the refectory of Christ in the Desert Monastery.
