and yet in good moments   
I am terrified more of admitting who I actually am.   
  
But i feel like whatever is coming is going to give us no choice.   
we are going to have to rise up,   
no matter how afraid we are inside,   
and BE exactly who it is this process has revealed.   
And what if...   
  
we are beautiful and powerful beyond measure.   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
I can hold this thought simultaneously.
