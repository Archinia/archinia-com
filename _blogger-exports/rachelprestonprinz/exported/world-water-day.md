With dwindling water resources in New Mexico, our groundwater is not recharging at a rate that we can sustain. Wells are dropping and becoming unusable. One of the ways we can get water into recharge zones is to get our acequias back up and running. It's spring cleaning time on the ditches! There is something YOU can do TODAY about this! Call your local mayordomo and volunteer!Â Together, WE can make a difference in New Mexico! El Aqua, Nuestra vida! Happy World Water Day!
