Another tempting treat from [NaturalHomes](http://www.naturalhomes.org/usa-naturalhomes.htm) wonderful natural building built by a woman; this is a [straw bale garden room](http://www.naturalhomes.org/usa-naturalhomes.htm) in East Meredith, NY, USA. It was built by Sita Sanders. Part of what makes this building so attractive is the climbing plants around the door, its connection to the earth and the low sheltering roof. See architectural patterns No.246, 168 and 117 [here](http://www.naturalhomes.org/fbr.pattern).
