I honestly never thought I'd be writing a blog post loving on a rag paper artist. But [Stephanie Lerma](http://www.stephanielerma.com/)'s works are gorgeous and rich and textural and I can't make myself NOT love them. This, along with two other pieces, is on view at the [Minatures and More](http://albuquerquemuseum.org/support/miniatures-more) exhibit at the [ABQ museum](http://www.cabq.gov/culturalservices/albuquerque-museum) thru Dec 8.
