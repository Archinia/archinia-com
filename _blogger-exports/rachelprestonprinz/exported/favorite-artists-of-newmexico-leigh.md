So, there's a pattern developing here I see... I love landscapes that are playful and colorful and captuire the magic underneath the raw beauty that is New Mexico. These, by [Leigh Gusterson](http://leighgusterson.com/) are no exception.  
The pieces in this collection are currently being shown in the exhibit [Minatures & More](http://albuquerquemuseum.org/support/miniatures-more), a fundraiser for the [ABQ Museum](http://www.cabq.gov/culturalservices/albuquerque-museum), showing through December 8.
