I adore [Ann Huston](http://www.decoloresgallery.com/ahuston/current_work.php)'s subtle, elegant, modern works. She's from Taos and her romantic buildingscapes make me fall in love with New Mexico over and over again.  
She's got some great pieces in the [Minatures and More](http://albuquerquemuseum.org/support/miniatures-more) exhibit at the [ABQ museum](http://www.cabq.gov/culturalservices/albuquerque-museum) thru Dec 8, 2013.
