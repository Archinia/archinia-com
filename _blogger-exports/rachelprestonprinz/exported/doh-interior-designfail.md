Disagree?Â   
For me, the Why is the confusion of it all. I'm half blind so the zigzag patterning is overwhelming anyway, but that it confuses me as to which doors I want to go in is the killer. Unless the right side is going to be the only to go IN. Then I guess its not so bad. But then there's all the boxes at the base of the stairs? Confusing when you have no depth perception. The stairs are already scary enough. This carpet layout makes no sense to me. and how lazy to not center the doors on the ceiling when you decide to make a statement.
