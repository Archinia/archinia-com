From a recent lecture based on Ken Foster's model of success, I took the following notes, which might be of help to more than just I.  
  

- _Establish your core values. What about success is important to you? Is it achievement? Loyalty? Money? Know what that is an see how it motivates you._
- _Establish a clearly defined visions based on your core values. _
- _Then establish responsibilities based on that vision._
- _The establish a desired outcome. _

_How to achieve these?_  

- _Surround yourself with people whose mindset is what you want to emulate._
- _Set a goal (or goals) about what you want, or want to overcome._
- _Take 5 actions steps every day to achieve each goal._
- _Make commitments and then keep them._
- _Repeat your mantras til you believe they are true (or possible.)_
