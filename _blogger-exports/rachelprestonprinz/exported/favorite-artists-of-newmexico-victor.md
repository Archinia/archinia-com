I first fell for [Victor Higgins](http://www.victorhiggins.com/)' work at the Taos County Courthouse. Despite that he wasn't _supposed_ to use biblical scenes on the secular county courthouse, he went all in with his Moses the Lawgiver piece for the WPA.Â

I love his cubist-influenced landscapes and his playful way of sharing the difficulty of New Mexico life through often putting storms in his scenes. This work, titled Taos Valley Landscape, is at the [ABQ Museum](http://www.cabq.gov/culturalservices/albuquerque-museum), and I think its great.
