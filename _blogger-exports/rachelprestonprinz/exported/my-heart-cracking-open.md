my heart has pounded so hard it broke  
again and again and again  
and the only balm that would soothe it is always invisible to me  
until it is not  
  
the sound of the hawk's wings slicing the air  
like knives made of pillows  
divebombing the white winged dove  
missing my head by just a few feet  
and startled by me as much as I by it,  
missing the dove too  
landing and squawking its dissatisfaction briefly  
as we stare at each other for a moment  
before it takes off into the dark evergreen tree in the neighbor's yard  
the one they will use for roosting between baby hawk training flights  
in just a few weeks now  
  
the dark stranger child who clamors onto my lap  
and lets me hold her  
the way I always wished I had been  
and was  
but it was so long ago I can't remember  
the way my gram would play with my hair til I fell asleep  
let me cry until my tear well dried up  
and stayed that way for a LONGGGGGGG time  
I hold her like the child inside me who longs to be held forever  
and she smiles and stays and doesn't move  
until I make her  
  
the spiraling quills of a tiny cactus  
10 years old and smaller than my fingernail  
spiraling towards and away from the center of the universe  
which all belonged to it  
I could feel it breathing in ancient breaths that lasted longer than my life will be  
a flower so small  
you need a jeweler's loop to see it  
  
my body  
beautiful fat body  
still limber and still succulent  
even though it feels like its not even mine anymoreÂ   
still oozing with sex and love and lust and magic  
still ripe with possibilities  
  
as if the young woman who is buried inside  
is still so young she doesn't know any better  
all she longs to do is taste the world  
and love it with wild abandon  
  
my dying eyes  
so tired  
that when I close them,  
the scent of fresh-cut lilac  
and cinnamon and saffron and turmeric spices from week old Moroccan food  
penetrates into the soul of my being  
reminding me that even without my eyes  
I'm still be able to see  
and that's why that little child loves my lap  
  
everflowing fountain within me  
born from the crack in the mountain I am,  
my heart bleeds, ripe... with life, experience, and a willingness to see the unseen  
  
and that is why  
I am not afraid  
of my heart cracking open
