[Miguel Martinez](http://www.miguelmartinezfinearts.com/) is probably my favorite contemporary santero-type artists. His work is so rich and feminine and beautiful. You can see it at the [ABQ Museum](http://www.cabq.gov/culturalservices/albuquerque-museum)'s [Minatures and More](http://albuquerquemuseum.org/support/miniatures-more) Exhibit through December 8.
