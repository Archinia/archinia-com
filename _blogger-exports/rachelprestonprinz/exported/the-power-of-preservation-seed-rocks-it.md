**Newest SEEDoc released on the Bancroft School Project**  
  
  
  
  

  

**Location:** Manheim Park Neighborhood, Kansas City, Missouri

  

**Project Description:** This ambitious project -- within the city’s Green Impact Zone -- includes three main parts: the re-use of a vacant neighborhood school, new affordable housing to replace blighted structures, and new outdoor public spaces. To address a long list of neighborhood challenges, residents collaborated with four lead organizations: BNIM -- the 2011 AIA National Architecture Firm of the Year, the Make It Right Foundation, the Historic Manheim Neighborhood Association and Neighborhood Housing Services. This team facilitated the participatory design process with the community in a “collaborative dialogue of discovery.” Another partner, Dalmark Development Group identified the funding metrics to ensure the project was sustainable in nature, both environmentally and economically. The project team has raised $2.1 million and is looking for the final $200k needed to build a LEED Platinum project. A community benefits agreement, fully approved by the community, is being used to assure that community expectations will be met.

  

**Specific Issues addressed:**
