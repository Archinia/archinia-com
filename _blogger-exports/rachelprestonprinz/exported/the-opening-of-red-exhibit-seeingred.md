The Red that Colored the World is on exhibit Museum of International Folk Art thru September 13, 2015. This is an exquisite exhibit is about cochineal - a cactus bug discovered in the New World - and other dyes... and how the color red changed the world over the centuries.  
  
I can't show you pics from the exhibit because photography isn't allowed (and what a shame), but here are a few highlights from the opening, where they had hands-one experiences that allowed us to work with the materials themselves. I highly recommend going to ANY exhibit opening at the Folk Art Museum. They are SUCH fun! For adults and kids!
