I first fell in love with the work of Albuquerque textile artist [Susan Klebanoff](http://www.susanklebanoff.com/p1.html) when I saw her piece at the [Nortbertine Community](http://www.norbertinecommunity.org/) of ABQ's Santa Maria de la Vid Chapel (back behind Mary, hanging on the wall...) It's an exquisite piece and I love her attention to detail. She's got many, many more at her website.
