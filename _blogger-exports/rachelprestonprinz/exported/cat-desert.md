Cat darkened with desertness  
And so have I  
Thick skin now folded  
Dark with age lines from learning  
  
Georgia got old here  
  
It seems we all do these days  
  
This is my New Mexico  
harsh with light  
and desiccation  
My hands and feet seek solace  
in springs and soft green grass  
Leaves so tender they don't cut my parched skin  
Mother Earth  
Mother moon  
Father sky  
Father sun  
Children and muses and christs  
and masked Indians  
and me  
all singing ancient songs  
that transcend time and place  
songs to the stars and ancestors and  
everything you could wish to believe in  
  
life is sacred here  
and harsh  
and light  
  
And there are flowers smaller than your fingernail  
Waiting to be discovered  
Living in moments in the desert  
  
Don't say she's barren  
  
She's resplendent  
  
If you just take a moment  
and breathe her in  
  
You might remember the miracle we all are  
  
Living on the edge brings a lively awareness that way
