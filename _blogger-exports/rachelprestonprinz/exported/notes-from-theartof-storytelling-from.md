A friend in film suggested that I watch The Art of Storytelling sessions from Pixar in a Box at the Khan Academy. I have only watched the first three videos in the series thus far, but there are several great suggestions in there! Here's a link to the free class!

Here are my favorite takeaways:  

- We already ARE storytellers. 
- A story is really a sequence of events (narrative) that unfolds through time. It begins, something happens, and it ends.
- To get good at storytelling, we should practice anywhere and everywhere: telling stories in front of the campfire, writing plays and novels and short stories, making movies, taking photos, and even tweeting each other. 
- To make a story really come alive, put something into the story that talks about your own life and how you FEEL. 
- It may take 30 iterations to make a story sparkle. Editing is essential!

And my favorite exercises:  

- Q: How did you start telling stories?
- Q: Where do you get your ideas from?
- If you are looking for ideas, write about the last time you... (did anything).
