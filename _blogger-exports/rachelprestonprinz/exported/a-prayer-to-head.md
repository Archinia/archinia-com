since I'm not much of a faithful person  
(not in the way most want me to be anyway)  
I struggle with the idea of prayer  
as if some bored omnipotent man  
with a beard as long as a model's legs  
is sitting in some gilded chair  
on a fluffy white cloud  
waiting for ME  
to humble myself enough  
for him to justify granting a miracle  
to someone who really, really needs it  
  
but last night under the full moon  
I started to think   
about all the peope I love  
the people I am grateful for  
the fact that I survived this year  
  
and not once due to my own doing  
but because of all those who were reaching out to me  
trying to save me from the darkness  
and the ones who didn't even know or care  
but were leading by example  
as they headed from their caves  
and into the light themselves  
staring down their own dark demons  
  
full of alive and well  
despite spitting vipers as big as houses  
hissing at them  
as they stretched their legs to stand tall  
  
afraid no more  
(sometimes because they had no other choice)  
  
The abundant reflected light  
in the dark of night  
was special  
  
  
but that wasn't what caused me to see what I saw.  
  
What I saw was  
that every time I thought of someone close to me -   
my family  
my friends  
my beloved  
my fuzzy  
in ever growing circles  
reaching further and further out  
into my sphere of influence...  
  
a light went on around that person.  
  
a light! really!  
A golden white light that pulsed with the stars  
and emanated warmth and KNOWING  
  
and I knew, that just for a second,  
that persons load... was lighter.  
even if they didn't know it was.  
  
I realized, that by...  
praying...  
for them...  
remembering them with love...  
I was sending them MY light.  
  
And while I was busy thinking of others,  
it was growing stronger, in me.
