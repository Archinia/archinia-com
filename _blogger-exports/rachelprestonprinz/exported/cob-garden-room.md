Sharing another great project from Natual Homes.  
This is the cob garden room at [O.U.R ecoVillage](http://www.ourecovillage.org/), Shawnigan Lake, Canada. The nasturtiums filter the light (pattern No. 238) in the room and growing so well make you bend down to enter (pattern No.224). [Here](http://www.naturalhomes.org/fbr.pattern) are the patterns that make a house beautiful to live in. You can eat nasturtium flowers and leaves. They give salad a peppery kick similar to watercress.
