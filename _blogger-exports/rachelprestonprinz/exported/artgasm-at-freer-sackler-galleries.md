The [Freer](http://www.asia.si.edu/) is closed for remodeling, which was a bummer because this little architect really wanted to see the renown Peacock Room.  
  
This delightful gallery has to be my favorite. I love it's takes on Iranian art, contemporary works, and mosaics.

However, it's sister gallery, [Sackler](http://www.asia.si.edu/) saved the day with it's extraordinary exhibit [ReMix: Darren Wattersons Filthy Lucre](http://www.asia.si.edu/filthylucre/about.asp), which re-envisions the demise of the room, and Whistler's exquisite original painting from the real Peacock Room, the Porcelain Princess, is on view.

Double bonus is the exquisitely simple  [Red](http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/current/red/) by Mark Rothko, which allows you to contemplate a Ming Dynasty basin against his modern piece, hung on the wall in a dimly lit room. Of the work, Rothko says,  
  

_"If you are only moved by color relationships, you are missing the point.  
I am interested in expressing the big emotions - tragedy, ecstasy, doom."_
