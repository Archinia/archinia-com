Slow Rise  
  
I peeled open my eyes  
slowly  
waiting for the sun  
the father  
on his holy day  
to come...  
this time  
he was only a wink  
in a dark sky  
predicating storm.  
waiting out the darkness  
is no fearful place for me now  
winter tales  
and firelight dancing  
has been the way for so long now  
in the tiny swath of sunlight  
I saw an iris blooming  
flash of Spring  
arriving...  
eyes open.
