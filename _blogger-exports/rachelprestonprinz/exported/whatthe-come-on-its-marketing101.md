So the other day, I was at the booth of this super cute designer at the farmer's market, and I asked her if there was a way I could get in touch with her about future custom orders. She hands me a card with her name on it, the name of her company, and NO EMAIL OR PHONE NUMBER. and NO ADDRESS. Just her name and her company. She tells me she's there every Thursday or whatever, and that "she doesn't do email" and her "phone is private".  
Whatever. lady. Get out of the business and find a gallery or a market to schlep your stuff.  
You're fired.  
  
Friends, do better than this. I know you can.
