We don't like Passiv Houses, and [this](http://www.treehugger.com/green-architecture/plague-both-their-passive-houses.html) is exactly the reason why. There's nothing Passive about the houses, they demand elaborate mechanical systems (which is great til the gas goes out), you can't open the windows... and they are oftentimes very ugly. There's a better way. It's a hybrid. And uses natural, local materials. â™¥
