My Manifesto of Faith in Design  
  

 _Mother_ _I humbly vow to hold sacred all that you are_ _I promise to be mindful of your needs, and the balance of taking and giving._ _I will use the sun, wind, and water to nourish you._ _I will replace what I use of yours._ _I will allow all the beings you are in relationship with, from worms to humans, _

_a place to grow and be strong,_

_ so your even your subtlest needs are met._ _I will honor your cycles._ _I will pray with you._ _I will help you to find healing._ _I will not take what I do not ask for._ _And I promise, _

_I will reach into you and ask for your guidance._

_  
I love you mother._ _Always your daughter,_ _Now, too, your protector_
