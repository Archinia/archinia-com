YES! A little archaeology applied to modern times... For those of you looking for some new reading material... [**this**](http://issuu.com/bermudaquest/docs/origins02/1) just came out last night! Issue 2 of Origins: It's time to rediscover where we came from. From Paleolithic burials to why we wed in white, this issue is packed with color and symbolism, plus an exclusive view of Dr. Mark Van Stone's "2012: Science and Prophecy of the Ancient Maya."
