Architect Takeo Kamiya is a Japanese architect with a passion for the architecture if India and Islam. He has spent most of his life traveling the subcontinent and documenting the history and design of the architecture of these cultures. He knows more about this architecture than probably most anyone in the world, and he's been censored for his efforts, which makes them even more important.  
  
Sacrifice for goodÂ  is one of the most noble things a person can do. His research and beautiful photographic documentation is a very special gift this architect is passing on to future generations.
