I have sought for the cure to the ailments of this troubled world for many, many moons now (30 years and more), at the feet of sages and in the books every religion claims to be sacred, and all I can find that I know 100% for certain will act as a balm for what ails us... is Love. But in order to love, we must lose ourselves. That is the single most important key. We MUST act. We MUST forgive. We MUST love above all else, at whatever cost we must personally pay. That is the REAL Secret.
