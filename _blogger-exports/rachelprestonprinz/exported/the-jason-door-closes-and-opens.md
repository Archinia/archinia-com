A few months back I started painting with no mind again  
the first thing I painted was an acrylic on canvas piece  
I called The Jason Door

I've been diving in to paint over the past year in fits and starts  
  
Fits over who I am  
and starts at trying to understand it  
Using paint as a way to try and find out what's really inside  
  
Gagging on the choking embers of an imaginary life  
that sparked up and flamed itself out  
and left me ashcovered... shaking... ungrounded  
and broken  
afraid  
and paralyzed  
  
like I haven't been since the day they called me into the office to tell me Jason was missing  
  
the day that took my breath away  
  
but yesterday  
yesterday I found myself sitting at a table  
with a dear friend, a broken marriage, and confusion  
admiring the setting sun reflected on the face of two soaring mountaintops connected by a long, grey saddle  
\*rustle\*  
  
and my friend was talking about how I could find my way to the sanctuaries I wanted to go to  
in the guidebook she had at home  
  
and how odd  
  
in the back of the guidebook  
there's a list of all the horrible climbing accidents there have been here  
\*rustle\*  
  
I get lost in staring at this mountain

Needles at the center and Crestone on the right, behind the closer mountains

Needles, the hard edged ones, strike fear into me  
  
\*gag\*  
  
shrouded in darkness as a cloud passes overhead  
  
\*spit\*  
  
Crestone, the one on the right, at the other send of the saddle, awash in light  
\*cough\*  
  
and I realize that  
10 years to the day  
  
_     completely by accident_  
  
I am in the place Jason took his last breath  
on that saddle  
between the light mountain he just summited  
and on his way to the dark one he never would...  
  
staring into the sunset reflected in the east  
  
shocked into silence for some time  
  
finally,  
I inhale deeply  
and say hello to my old friend  
who I miss terribly  
  
and who I can almost feel again...  
  
a thousand tears later...  
I know  
finally  
he is safe

in fact he couldn't me more okay  
this is a place where sages are born  
and he became one of the land's teachers  
as he had every qualification to be  
  
Architect, Seminarian, a new old soul  
  
Peace be upon you, Groo.  
And, upon me too...  
now that I understand.  
  
   
The most exquisite place, Crestone.  
A fine place to get lost  
find yourself  
breathe in deeply the essence of life  
  
and become one with the sunset's reflection  
  
  

  

_thank you to all the angels that brought that together.  
I bow to you, in awe._
