I LOVE Poteet Victory's series of [abbreviated portraits](http://www.mclarrymodern.com/poteetvictory_inter_abbr_port.html) at [McLarry Modern](https://www.facebook.com/mclarrymodern) gallery on Canyon Road in Santa Fe. This one is **AN D WRHL.**  
  
Great stuff! And Poteet is a cool guy too. I've spent some time in the studio with him and he's really awesome.
