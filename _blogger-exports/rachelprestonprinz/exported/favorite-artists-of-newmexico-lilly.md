Being a historic architect, and anti-po-mo, I am quite amazed that I love modern art as much as I do. I am certain that part of this influence comes from my dear friends, artists [Patrick Espy](http://www.patrickespystudio.com/) and [Joe Hutchinson](http://www.jmhutchinson.com/), who have helped me to see things in new ways. When I saw this piece by Vienese born Albuquerque artist [Lilly Fenichel](http://www.davidrichardgallery.com/Exhibit_Detail.cfm?ShowsID=108) at the [ABQ Musuem](http://www.cabq.gov/culturalservices/albuquerque-museum), I was deeply moved. It's emotional without being sappy, colorful without being "too much", and somehow reaches into me and tells me a story. I love it.
