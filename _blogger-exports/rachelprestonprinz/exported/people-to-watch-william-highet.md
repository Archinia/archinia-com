William Highet is a retired architect with a mission. His passion for a favorite historic neighborhood, The Royal Mile of Edinburg, which was falling into ruins, caused him to spend several years of his life (with the help of his wife) documenting the structures along the historic lane in exquisite detail. His final piece from his efforts - a panoramic painting nearly 30 feet long - documented every corbel, every spire of this lane... which led to its preservation. His is a labor of love - one that most architects would not undertake for free. And it has been said by many that he saved a community by his efforts.
