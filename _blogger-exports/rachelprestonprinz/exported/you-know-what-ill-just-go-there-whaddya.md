I sat down across from him at lunch today  
and he asked me about my non-profit  
I stumbled and stammered  
tripping over the oozing content of who I am  
as I poured myself back into my skin suit for "normal" time  
and tried to make a sentence understandable to anyone but me  
  
as usual I couldn't  
but he could tell my heart was in the trying  
  
at least there's that  
  
only  
I'm not my skin suit.  
I barely recognize myself  
  
when I look in the mirror I am horrified  
because the me I am  
is not the me I see  
and the me I am knows she did this to me  
scaredycat bearmother hiding in a cave that I have been  
  
but hey that's not the point here  
  
when I was done moulding myself into someone I desperately wanted to be  
I came home and prayed for an opportunity to miss this afternoon's meeting  
and it came with a member of the other team not being able to be wrangled  
  
score one for me  
  
I sat and read @DanielleLaPorte  
who's fault this all is  
and wove that into whoever told me today  
"think adventure not crisis"  
added a heaping helping of four new [Core Desired Feelings](http://www.daniellelaporte.com/cdf/)  
and bathed inÂ Matt Kahn 's idea that maybe, just maybe  
we can be lightbearers of heart centered consciousness  
which is her point too  
  
and realized I am here to be a storyteller.  
  
that is not all I am supposed to be  
( there's also lit up, authentic, seen, and aligned, to name a few...)  
  
but STORYTELLER is the important part  
and no amount of scared is going to stop it  
there's no numbing can dull the pain  
  
there is, however, a business plan to write  
  
I am not what I was and not yet what I am  
  
still it is time
