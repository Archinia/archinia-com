Well, how about that? I knew all that wine I drink would come in handy someday. If you happen to enjoy a bottle of wine now and then, you could perhaps save the corks and [build your own](http://www.cordwoodconstruction.org/) Casa de Corchos (House of Corks) from [La Bioguia FB page](https://www.facebook.com/LaBioguia/timeline). Very creative and visually intriguing.
