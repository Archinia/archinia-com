Are you fascinated by rock art? Have you ever wondered about how scientists learn about ancient  
civilizations? If so, then this program is for you. Bring your family and discover what archaeologists do and how they help us understand our ancient past. Visitors will have an opportunity to examine some of the tools archaeologist use and the artifacts they discover in this free experiential program. Representatives of the Albuquerque Archaeological Society will be at Casa to share their knowledge about how archaeologists study and preserve our ancient heritage. Visitors may also enjoy informal tours of this adobe home’s Spanish Colonial rooms or participate in a rock art craft activity.
