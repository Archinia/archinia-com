After spending 15 years after school in real architecture firms doing real work, still reading a plethora of sources on what makes 'great architecture' and seeing that there's a huge gap where Ego and Science diverge from Reason and Practicality (let alone Beauty, whose been completely forgotten of late)... I thought I'd give you all a taste of some ideas that might actually inspire you to look at Architecture as something more...  
  
With love and light and hope... and a commitment to helping you attain your dreams (and not just the ones your profs tell you you should have...)
