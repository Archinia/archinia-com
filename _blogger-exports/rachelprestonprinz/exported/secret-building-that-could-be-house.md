This building is in England. It was built over a period of several years starting in the 1980's. It was initially started as a shed for sheep but over time he continued adding to it as the owner was also an artist. It was never finished as the landowner never had planning permission for it and the local council stopped him from continuing. As such it is not a building that was ever lived in but the room with stained glass windows was used by the landowner for wine and poetry evenings with his friends. To give a sense of scale, the doors are normal sized doors. This is not a miniature house, it is full size.
