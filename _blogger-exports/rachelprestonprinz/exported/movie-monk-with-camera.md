[](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/monk_with_a_camera/)If you enjoy documentaries, art, Buddhist thought, or the idea of a monastic life, you may really enjoy this movie. I did. Very much. The story is engaging, the art is excellent, and the lessons within are well worth the time.  
  
  
What this movie reminded me:  
The Buddhist way is to: a) be a better person, b) be a less selfish person, and c) develop a concern for others.  
  
The way to achieve these:  
Be simple  
Be direct  
Be selfless  
Be generous  
Be humble  
Be patient
