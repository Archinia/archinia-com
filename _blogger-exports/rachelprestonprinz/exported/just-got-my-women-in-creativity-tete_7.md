I have been waiting so patiently…  

(Well, at least on good days)

  

A month or so ago

I painted a bunch of tiny cards 

to trade with women all over the world 

as a part of Women in Creativity month in Albuquerque.

  

Today, when the mailman came, he rang the doorbell...

I knew something exciting was happening...

And it was better than the package from Target that he delivered.

  

Nestled behind the parcel, 

in front of everyone's mail but mine...

a thick envelope...

from The National Hispanic Cultural Center… 

  

I knew what was inside...

  

I ripped open the envelope, excitedly, to find… 

a present to unwrap!!!

And when I did just that, a treasure map to unfurl...

Filled with tiny art prayers from women around the country...

  

And now it's on my altar. 

Intact and whole, 

with each card, a promise for a new discovery.

  

Because my tears won't let me look just yet.
