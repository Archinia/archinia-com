HISTORY GOES TO THE DOGS  
  
Saturday, April 12 • 1 – 4 p.m.  
  
In this Second Saturday Program Casa San Ysidro will be going to the dogs, but in a good way. Learn about the history of dogs in the Southwest and take home some dog training tips for your own Fido. At 1 p.m. dog trainer Barbara Mitchell from the Sandia Dog Obedience Club and her furry friends present a dog training demonstration designed especially for children and their families. At 2:30, Dody Fugate, Curator of  Archaeological Research Collections, Museum of Indian Arts and Culture, presents Tails of Long Ago, a family-friendly talk about dogs in the ancient Southwest. In this illustrated talk, Ms. Fugate will explain where dogs came from and the importance of dogs to the early peoples in New Mexico. Ms. Fugate is nationally recognized for her knowledge of prehistoric dogs and their relationship with the Puebloan and Ancestral Puebloan people who lived in the region centuries ago. This program is open to all, but please leave your pets at home.
