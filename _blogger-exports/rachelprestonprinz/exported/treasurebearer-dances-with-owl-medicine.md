once upon an Italian sunset  
we sent each other to bed crying  
  
he was so kind, angry, and so very real  
my first contact  
with a vulnerable  
broken  
perfect  
thing  
  
he made black pictures and offered them to me  
to hang on my wall  
for what I'd done  
(he may never forgive me for the many times I have failed him)  
and yet I love him with my whole being  
  
  
neither of us knew then that it is my job  
that some medicines are both poison and cure  
  
he always saw me for who I truly am  
and, he gave my my totem  
  
I treasure the moments I get to bask in it all
