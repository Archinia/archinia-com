I love [Jill Christian](http://jillchristian.com/)'s pointillistic stretchy colorscapes.  
This, one of three works, each called Anatole and then numbered, is currently being shown in the exhibit [Minatures & More](http://albuquerquemuseum.org/support/miniatures-more), a fundraiser for the [ABQ Museum](http://www.cabq.gov/culturalservices/albuquerque-museum), showing through December 8.
