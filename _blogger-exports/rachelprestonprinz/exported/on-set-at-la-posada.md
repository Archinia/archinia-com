So this spring we went to La Posada in Arizona, and shot an episode of my tv show about architecture and sustainability in the Southwest. I was going thru some photos the other day, and found these stills from behind the scenes that I didn't even know about because my hubby was taking them!. I love this job!  
And my team!  
Zenne and Daniel are the best!
