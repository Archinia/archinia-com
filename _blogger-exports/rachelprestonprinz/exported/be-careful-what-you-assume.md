_"On a cold January Day, a forty-three year old man was sworn in as executive of his country. By his side stood his predecessor, a famous general who, 15 years earlier, had commanded his nation's armed forces in a war that resulted in the defeat of Germany. The young leader was raised in the Roman Catholic faith. He spent the next five hours watching parades in his honor and stayed up celebrating until 3 o'clock in the morning."_  
  
You know who I am describing, right?  
  
Hint: It's January 30, 1933.  
  
So... No, it's not John Fitzgerald Kennedy, as you probably guessed.  
  
The man is Adolph Hitler.  
  

  

  

**...Everyone makes assumptions.           **

**Sometimes we make the wrong ones.**
