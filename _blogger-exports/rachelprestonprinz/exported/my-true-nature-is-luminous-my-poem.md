(whispers, because I don't know if I can say this any louder than the sound of cloud passing by...)  
  
my true nature is luminous  
momentous  
bursting  
erupting in diamond encrusted flares  
like a jewel encased star gone supernova  
  
I know that I am made of light  
.  
the only time I ever doubt  
the only time I question  
is when I listen to those those slithering seething sounds of doubt  
the world whispers to me  
  
you are not enough  
.  
I believe that sometimes,  
and then I remember that the world is sick, twisted, dark, lonely, fearful  
  
And I, none of those things  
.  
my soul soars  
is afraid of nothing, noone  
it is blindly ignorant of everything that I'm supposed to care about  
and listens instead to the unspoken between the spaces we fill with words  
and acts on that.  
Maybe foolishly, it whole+heartedly believes  
that I  
and we  
are capable of almost anything  
when we agree to believe  
to the best of our unique ability  
.  
And of all of the things that I know that I know  
I know most that there are no two things that will ever be the same  
and that I can never ever really know  
well, anything  
.  
I revel in opportunity, curiosity, hope...  
and seeking to be the change  
  
Only now that I'm older and wiser,  
I don't seek to be  
as much as I refuse to let me stop myself  
from doing the things  
that I know nobody else is going to do  
because no one else has this voice,  
this passion,  
this knowing,  
this grace,  
this curiosity,  
this unfailing knowing  
that we might,  
we could,  
we know...  
we must...  
  
we are the only ones that can  
make a difference  
  
and if we need a hero,  
we must find her amongst ourselves  
  
which means we have to each be one
