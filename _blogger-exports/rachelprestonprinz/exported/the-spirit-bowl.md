my Acoma Grandmothers   
made sure to teach me  
to offer the first taste of my meal  
into a small bowl at the center of  the table  
The Spirit Bowl they call it  
in honor of the ancestors  
we feed them as if they are here  
and speak of them as if they are too  
because they are and forever will be  
  
(((right here))) in the secret and sacred part of my heart  
  
after the meal, they said  
take it outside  
and offer it to Nature  
and she will be fed and able to nourish us all  
the balance will be restored  
  
we've taken so much  
and offered so little  
and lost so much  
  
maybe it's time  
we filled our Spirit Bowls again
