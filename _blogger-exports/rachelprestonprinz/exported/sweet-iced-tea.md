it's like mother's milk to me  
my southern extraction  
black and orange pekoe  
brewed to perfection  
dark and sweet  
like a man or two that I have been known to love  
and with enough sugar  
to take the bite of of any heart aching sting  
when i close my eyes and remember  
this all started  
on a hot day  
with air thick like mud  
where my skin felt at one with the river  
running by but a mile away  
my soul leaking into her through my sweat  
feeding the mother with my own being  
and like the taste of my wet...  
ahem... (shame on you!)  
it's better when I'm fueled by sweet tea  
nourishing the world through succulence  
soaking sweet wetness  
now that's southern charm  
  
Many props to my girls @HolisticCynthia @MagdahliaStudio @DanielleLaPorte  
for the inspiration to start writing again! xoxo
