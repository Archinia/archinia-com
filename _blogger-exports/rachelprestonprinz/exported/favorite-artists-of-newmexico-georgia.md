It's the woman herself - [Georgia O'Keeffe](http://www.okeeffemuseum.org/art--exhibitions.html).  
Her [museum](http://www.okeeffemuseum.org/) in Santa Fe is EPIC.  
This piece is at the [ABQ Museum](http://www.cabq.gov/culturalservices/albuquerque-museum).  
For those of us who reside in New Mexico, this is a poigant reminder of the moradas.
