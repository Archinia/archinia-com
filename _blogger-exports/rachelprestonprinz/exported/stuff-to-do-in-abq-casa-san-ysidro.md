Saturday, May 17 • 10 a.m. – 4 p.m.  
  
Casa joins with the Corrales Historical Society to celebrate our local heritage with a day of fun family activities. This is a good opportunity to explore New Mexico’s agricultural and cultural traditions. Enjoy performances, weaving, blacksmith and horno baking demonstrations, purchase traditionally-created art from local artists, and explore the Museum’s period rooms to see artifacts that reflect how people lived long ago.
