Karl Blossfeldt (1865-1932) was a German sculpture instructor who had been trained as an apprentice in an iron casting foundry. He studied art at Berlin Institute of Royal Arts and Museum (College of Fine Arts)Â  between 1884 and 1890. In 1890-1896, while collecting plant specimens in Italy for a drawing class, Blossfeldt started systematically documenting plant samples photographically.  
  
His works highlight the architectural nature of plant materials and can be studied to provide a source of inspiration, and likely a bit of awe. Enjoy!
