A tip for those who are wanting to use nature to stay a little warmer this winterâ€¦ Open your blinds on the south and west sides of your house when it starts getting warm every morning. Allow these rooms to absorb all of the heat of the warm sun as it streams in these windows. Use insulated drapes on windows on the north and east sides of your home and keep them closed on snowy or cloudy cold days if you can. Close all drapes and blinds before the sun goes down. These little tricks will help you to use nature to your benefit, keep your energy costs down, and keep you warmer all winter long!
