I feel bad for taking such a blurry shot of this work by amazing photographer [Amadeus Leitner](http://www.amadeusleitner.com/). His right, simple, modern photographic work is incredible. This piece, along with two others, is on view at the [ABQ Musuem](http://www.cabq.gov/culturalservices/albuquerque-museum) through Dec 8 2013 in the [Minatures and More](http://albuquerquemuseum.org/support/miniatures-more) fundraising exhibit.
