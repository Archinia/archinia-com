Last week, I gave a tour of Taos Plaza and a talk on the Murals of Taos for the 100th Anniversary celebrations of the Taos Society of Artists. There was an awesome flamenco group that opened the afternoon lectures, and I caught a few snaps of them with my iphone before I went on! Such great ladies, and performers!
