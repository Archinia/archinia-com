People ask me all the time how I take such great photos, and I have to tell you - it's a few things anyone can manage...  

- have a good camera you love to use and know well
- take every photo you can. you aren't taking enough if you don't have your camera on you at all times, and your friends don't start laughing and saying "there s/he goes again" the minute you reach for it.
- take photos at daybreak and the end of the day. watch the lighting. Master this and you can handle anything. And daylight photos will be super easy.
- always focus on the darkest part of what you want to frame. The light will work for that and the rest will follow.
- did I mention practice?
- use the 9 part grid that is a setting on every digital camera these days to teach yourself to line your shot up on the lines. you'll learn great framing in no time.

  
Okay, I hope these tips and tricks help!
