there was a icy chill to the morning  
hoarfrost on the mirror of my RAV  
my first excursion out in days  
everything was still because of the holiday and the dusting of snow  
i drove purposely slow  
i didn't know why  
til she ambled out from behind a tree and across the road in front of me  
resplendent from an easy winter  
she kept walking and never dropped her gaze  
we passed each other as if we were in a slow motion movie  
her eyes looking straight into mine  
I opened the window and called  
hey sugar baby, you sure are a pretty little thing  
I hope you're havin a good winter  
I love you  
and I smiled  
and I swear to god she quite nearly walked right up to me
