Father Bill is truly one of the great modern iconographers. He's a magical man, too. This is the original of this extraordinary work of his, called [Mary Most Holy Mother of All Nations](http://www.fatherbill.org/all-categories/product/168-mary-most-holy-mother-of-all-nations). It's a real treat to get to see it in a very special private collection. Thank you to Michael K. for allowing me the privilege!!
