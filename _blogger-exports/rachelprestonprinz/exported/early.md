Early morning Santa Fe -  

It's a different place 

than the _city different_ the tourists know

the greet the dayers - early risers -

get up to urge forth the sun

from its slowly waking slumber 

up and over the undulating horizon

  

with carpools and bike rides and speed walks 

and homeless shuffling away from the city center like oxen laden with goods

time to start the new day!

and the sun obeys

  

the light is just like Venice in the afternoon

which of course is why the artists stayed

when they came here with bodies choking with tuberculosis

  

the asylum became home

and sanctuary its offering

  

despite throngs of visitors now

some things haven't changed
