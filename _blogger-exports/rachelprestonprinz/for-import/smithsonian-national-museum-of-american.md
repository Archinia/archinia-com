I worked on the design of the building as a wee baby architect. Smithgroup hired my firm to assist with structural and mechanical coordination, and for landscape design detailing for the old patio, which is now being redesigned and reinstalled.  
  
It was so amazing after all these years to come back and see the building that I suffered over!  
  
A sweet Albanian girl was outside taking a million pictures with her family, and she about flipped when she found out I worked on the building. She wants to be an architect. I was over the moon to get photos with her.
