"Back in April I posted about [James Turrell's Skyspace at Rice University](http://archidose.blogspot.com/2012/04/turrellings.html), a flat-topped, 72-foot-square pyramid housing a seating area for viewers. The Skyspace opened on June 14, and Rice has posted a video with commentary from some of the people involved (unfortunately not Turrell) and some students impressions of the new addition to the campus's public art."
