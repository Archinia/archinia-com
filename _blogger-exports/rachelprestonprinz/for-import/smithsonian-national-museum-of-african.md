The morning before #SXSL, I caught a @Lyft to the White House.  
I walked over to the new [Smithsonian National Museum of African American History & Culture](https://nmaahc.si.edu/).  
It's kindof awesome, even from the outside.Â

David Adjaye spoke about the work, and others, with James Turrell that morning, as part of the #SXSL event. The White House taped it for everyone.  

  

  
  
The work of James Turrell reminds me a bit of a local architect friend of mine, Jon Dick, whose most recent work I featured [on this blog](http://newmexicoarchitecture.blogspot.com/2015/10/kiva-chapel-of-light-new-celebration-of.html) last year.
