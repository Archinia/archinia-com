I dwell in Possibility -  
A Fairer House than Prose -  
More Numerous of Windows -  
Superior - for Doors -  
  
Of Chambers as the Cedars -  
Impregnable of Eye -  
And for an Everlasting Roof -  
The Gambrels of the Sky -  
  
Of VisitorsÂ  - the fairest -  
For Occupation - This -  
The spreading wide my narrow Hands -  
To gather Paradise.
