_Sharing some of the internship assignments we give all our interns..._

  

  
If you have not done so already, go to [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) and start your professional profile.  
  
Develop a bio (500 words or less). Keep this updated as your skillset evolves. I recommend setting a google calendar alarm to remind you to do this every 60-90 days. (Once you get further along in your career, you can do this review every 6 months or so.) Get feedback from your peers and mentors for edits that will help you showcase your talents more effectively.  
  
Get a good headshot and upload to your profile.  
  

**Follow these [tips](http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2012/03/14/how-to-spiff-up-your-linkedin-profile-and-land-your-dream-job) to make your LinkedIn Profile shine!**

  
[Connect with us](http://linkedin.com/in/RachelPrestonPrinz) on LinkedIn to show us your work!  
  
Join LinkedIn groups that focus on your interests. Spend 1 hour a week, or even just 10 minutes a day, reviewing notes from your groups. Comment. Participate. This will help you to build your expertise and build relationships. Networking brings opportunities. This is a good time to plug participation in professional organizations... AIA is a great organization, and there are others. If you go, you will grow!  
  
Build an online version of your resume/CV and portfolio. Link that to your LinkedIn Profile.
