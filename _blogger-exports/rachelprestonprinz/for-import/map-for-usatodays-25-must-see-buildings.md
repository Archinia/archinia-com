So, a few weeks ago, USAToday posted a list of the [25 essential buildings to see in New Mexico](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2017/05/10/new-mexico-buildings/101504142/#) that they got from the AIA. I personally think there are some missing, and some that shouldn't be there (Pearl Hall? Really? Over Hussan Fahty's Dar al Islam in Abiquiu?) But this is a fine starting place. The thing they did NOT do was add a map so you could actually find your way to any of the sites when you come to visit. So I put one together really quickly so you can print it out and get there! â™¥  
Enjoy!
