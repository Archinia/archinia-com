A few shots of my girlfriend Cherie's fabulous home in Bernalillo, which she just listed on the market...  
it feels like a quiet oasis and is located just 20 minutes down an agricultural road from the "big city" of Albuquerque.  
  
It features an H-shaped plan, a beautiful front courtyard, and fabulous plaster details over a lovely and well-built strawbale infill wall supported by a partially-exposed steel structure that nods to timberframe.  
  
An open living space on one end of the home and family living spaces on the other end are separated by a decorative gallery off the stunning entrance courtyard. This is a home that is truly extraordinary, for a family with an appreciation of artisanry, and who loves to entertain.  
  
Many of the details of the building are AMAZING. The soaring ceilings are extraordinary. It looks like such a simple little home on the outside. On the inside, it is anything but!
