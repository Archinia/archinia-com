More from Oliver at Natural Homes  
A collection of thatching around the world with more details [here](http://www.naturalhomes.org/thatch.htm). Thatch can have an extremely long lifespan on a building. A thatcher will leave the base coat of thatch on the house adding new fresh straw or reed. This practice goes back centuries, so much so that in Britain there are approximately 250 examples of original base coats that survive from the late medieval period (1350-1600).
