The single most distinctive landmark in maybe all of America, the [Washington Monument](https://www.nps.gov/wamo/index.htm), a shining beacon of American spirit, is always helping you locate yourself in DC. Really, it's a two-part landmarking process, since you can always find the monument but then you need to find another building to tell you where in relation to the monument you are. Still, It's everywhere in my photos from all over the city. Here are some of my fave shots.
