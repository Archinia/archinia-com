Take Home Written Final Exam:

  

Answer the following questions:

  
How does the architecture of the Gothic period and what you learned in Pillars of the Earth relate to your new design philosophy?

  

Architecture was once an integrated science. Architects were masons, and knew how to handle not only the stone, but the math and geometry of the solar path through their latitude! When the world turned to consumption of cheap materials and the use of mechanical systems, we lost something. What lessons have you learned from your history concentration that you can take with you to minimize the need for energy-consuming materials today?
