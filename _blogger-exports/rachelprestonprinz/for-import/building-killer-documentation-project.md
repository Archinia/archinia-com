Steps to building the best architectural or archaeological documentation project.  

- Conduct local interviews.
- Conduct good research, and re-verify everything over 5 years old is still accurate (history has a way of changing without the historians noticing).
- Get on the ground! Explore! Listen to why your experts think what they do and see if your "inner voice" agrees with the possibility.
- Stay ahead of trends - what's happening at the front edge of the field will often help you build a better project document.
- Reverse -engineer your design criteria from modern standards to verify your observations are possible.
- Be open!
