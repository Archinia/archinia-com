My Best Architecture Movies Guide on here gets more hits than any other post I have done, so when someone asked if I'd ever compiled a list of labyrinths in movies (since I design original labyrinths too), I decided I'd better start one. For all you labyrinth-o-philes, here's your list too:  
  
_Alice in Wonderland_  
_Cube_  
_Dragonquest_  
_Extinction_  
_Goblet of Fire_  
_The Goonies_  
_Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_  
_Hellboy_  
_Inception_  
_Labyrinth_  
_Law and Order: Criminal Intent: Icarus (episode)_  
_Nosferatu_  
_Pan's Labyrinth_  
_Resident Evil 3_  
_Tangled_  
_The Shining_  
_Tales from the Crypt_  
_The Third Man_  
_Your Highness (be prepared, cheesy stoner content! lol!)_
