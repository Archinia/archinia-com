I recently had the opportunity to travel to Jemez New Mexico for a retreat at the Fitzgerald Center.  
For those that do not know, this was where the Catholic church used to send priests who were found to be sexual abusers. I expected the place to have an icky vibe. instead, it was quite lovely. And healing. Especially to some I know who were terrified of going there because of it's past.  
  
What astounded me was that this place had the capacity to continue healing people, despite our association with it. I suppose if it could heal the priests, it can heal anyone.
