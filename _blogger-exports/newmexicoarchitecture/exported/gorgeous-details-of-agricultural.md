I got the very rare opportunity to visit this off-the-beaten-path Ag station a few weeks back. This poor broke down Spanish Pueblo Revival structure is gorgeous despite its desolation and abandonment of maintenance.  
  
I hope the State figures out they could make it a regional event center and raise the money to fix it up. â™¥
