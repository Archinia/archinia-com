In Northern New Mexico, Territorial period architecture was modified with a pitched metal roof. It can be assumed that at least part of the cause for this was weather-related, as a pitched roof will shed snow. Because of the scaricity of skilled crafters and the lack of railroad access  in Northern New Mexico, when Territorial in other locations was getting quite decorative, the style of architecture in the North was simplified - with very simple decorations and no use of brick. The combination was given its own style, called The Northern New Mexico style,  distinguished by:  


_Structure, Walls, and Exterior_  

- Adobe construction in one story
- U-shape or L-shape building footprint 
- Earth-toned mud or cement stucco plaster, and
- Little or no ornamentation

_Roof_  

- Flat, hipped, or gable pitched metal roof

_Interior_  

- Sometimes central hallway in Territorial fashion

_Windows_  

- Wood Windows

_Doors_  

- Panel wood doors, rarely with half-lite window glazing

_ Details_  

- Courtyards and colonade porches, often along one entire side of the building
