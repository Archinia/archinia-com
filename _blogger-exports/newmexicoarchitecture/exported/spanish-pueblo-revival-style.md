Those that would look backwards were led by the talented architect John Gaw Meem as well as the architectural firm of Rapp and Rapp. These two powerhouses of great design fused a revival of both the Pueblo and the Spanish Colonial styles into a fused whole that is unique to New Mexico. This architectural style is called Spanish-Pueblo Revival.  
  
Within 30 years of statehood, New Mexican architecture had evolved dramatically. Where before her structures were very nearly purely vernacular - being heavily influenced by the ideals of simplicity and economy - buildings in the early 20th century became, well… architectural. They were formalized, codified, and elaborated upon to distinguish the frill and fluff from the necessary. Those that could afford to emphasize grand design did so, and those that would or could not opted for various adaptations of the precedent styles, often using them in new and innovative ways.  
  
Spanish Pueblo-Revival style architecture is characterized by:  
  
_Structure, Walls, and Exterior_  

- A return to adobe construction, often with battered walls
- An undulating stepped, parapeted roof line 
- Rounded corners
- Earth-colored plaster stucco on exterior
- Stepped facades on multistory buildings
- At and above grade foundations

_Roof_  

- Low-pitched or “flat” roof supported by exposed vigas or faux vigas

_Interior_  

- Corner fireplaces
- Decorative stepped adobe walls (also on exterior)

_Windows_  

- Wood Windows, sometimes with decorative divided lites
- Sometimes stained glass

_Doors_  

- Panel wood doors, sometimes with half-lite window glazing

_ Details_  

- Carved wooden details on doors, window grills, & corbels
- Courtyards and colonade porches
