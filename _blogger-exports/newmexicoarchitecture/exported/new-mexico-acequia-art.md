Natural acequias at Taos Town Hall

  

  

  
  
The first _acequias_, as discovered by the Spanish. Pueblo people used to use natural watercourses, damming them and creating ponds so they could control the flow of the natural watercourses.

In the second wave, Hispanic settlers installed acequias where they wanted them, within the limitations of the landscape, using natural swells and drainages in concert with a rich topographical understanding.

Eventually acequias became a part of our "natural" landscape, so subtle and taken for granted that they were almost forgotten, and many were allowed to break down irreparably.Â  But all is not lost! Communities throughout the state are working now to save their acequias and bring the water back to their fields.
