A proposed plan to build a resort retreat center to the area directly adjacent to the Sanctuario de Chimayo has polarized many residents in the small hamlet, as well as a great many preservation and sacred site activists in the state of New Mexico. The story, as we've watched it unfold, goes something like this... (click on links in text for the referred article, site or book)

A letter started it all...

  

_Dear Friends,_

_The front page of the 12-22-11 SANTA FE NEW MEXICAN featured a [galvanizing article](http://draft.blogger.com/goog_1640143465) on recent plans for Chimayo: "Building spirituality or ruining it".  A Santa Fe entrepreneur is working with the Catholic Church to develop (one might even say "devour") the properties and hillside in front of El Santuario at El Potrero. Their development plan calls for a sprawling, 2-story complex called "Jardín de Los Niños Spiritual Retreat"  that will be built directly in front of and close to El Santuario._

_The same people pushing for the retreat are responsible for turning the once somber, authentic Santo Niño chapel into what has been described as a "sanitized Disneyesque farce," suggesting what the area across from El Santuario might well look like if they are given free rein to build a retreat center. _

_El Santuario is listed on the State Registry of Historic properties and the Federal Registry of National Historic Landmarks. Unfortunately, Santa Fe County currently has very lax standards for property development in Chimayo.  _

_After several weeks of meetings with Santa Fe County and the Chimayo community we know the following: _

_The majority of people in Chimayo DO NOT want this to happen.  Already, their antipathy is shared by many in Santa Fe County and beyond.   _

_The plans for the retreat center were not revealed to Chimayo residents until the story was leaked in a 12-3-11 ALBUQUERQUE JOURNAL SANTA FE/NORTH (AP) article.  _

_The retreat center is to be built on lands owned by both the Archdiocese of Santa Fe and an international Catholic organization called The Sons of the Holy Family.  The Santa Fe Archdiocese is allowing their land to be developed by the Santa Fe businessman, though the details of their relationship are nebulous. _

_The architectural plans (see NEW MEXICAN article map) ignore legal easements used by private property owners in the neighborhood. _

_One thing is certain: If built,  the proposed retreat center will overwhelm what many believe to be one of New Mexico's most important and unique historic sites and will make the historic neighborhood unlivable.  The Church also owns 40 acres of land just south of El Potrero so more building may be in store._

_HOW CAN YOU HELP? _

_The retreat center is in the process of having their plans reviewed by Santa Fe County Zoning and Planning agencies.  Sadly, the existing rules and regulations for property development in Santa Fe County are very broad and allow properties around historically sensitive places to be developed piecemeal.   However, the County is about 8 months away from putting in place new rules and regulations that may include more restrictive "site specific" guidelines for historic areas like El Santuario. _

_Please send a brief email or letter to the contact names below saying that the "Jardín de Los Niños Spiritual Retreat"  SHOULD NOT BE BUILT near the Santuario and encouraging the County to halt approval of all applications for zoning changes and for new construction near the Santuario de Chimayo until a comprehensive plan is in place that will protect the lives of residents of El Potrero and the historic integrity of the Santuario.    _

_Second, please print out and sign the petition (see attached pdf) and mail it to the address below.  It will be included among the signed petitions that we will present to County Commissioners at a public meeting._

_Strong public outcry is the only hope we have.  _

_Please forward this to anyone you know who can help and thank you so much! _

_Sincerely,_

_FRIENDS OF EL SANTUARIO_

Marta Weigle, New Mexico's distinguished folklorist and University of New Mexico Professor Emerita passed along this first newspaper article and appeal from Elizabeth Kay about the proposed retreat center to some of her friends in Chimayo and some preservation peers in New Mexico. Within days, word had spread through the town and through the preservation community. She is widely credited as the reason this project is receiving a form of architectural and preservation due diligence. As one Chimayo resident said, "Maybe we wouldn't have known about this until the bulldozers showed up."
