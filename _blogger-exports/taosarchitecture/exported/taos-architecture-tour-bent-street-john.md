As we walk west on Bent Street, notice the many buildings along the north side. Most of them date from the period 1830-1870.

The first long row of attached shops has special details that you can take in if you just take the time to look. I always point out the cool murals around the windows and doors at Taos Blue and Taos Artisans' Co-Op. BTW - Stop in at La Chiripada if you are ready for a glass of wine as we wind down this tour de Taos. They have some solidly good reisling! ; )

There are great shops all along Bent, and if you are hungry, Taos favorite Lambert's is pretty decent, with a great patio. If you want to continue on to the end of the street, there are several cool buildings along the way. One of my favorites is the Parsons' Gallery, which has the last of the four zaguans we cover in this tour. The art here is second to none. Then head back to the John Dunn Shops as we wind things up.

Heading south at the John Dunn Shops (Taos Blue Trail Site #10), this folk territorial buildings have been updated, but still retain the flavor of their past. This is also one of the best garden-rich areas in Taos. I love it in the spring and summer when it is in full bloom. Its a great people watching spot as well, and I tell my guests to come here rather than the tourist-centric plaza for shopping. When you get to the dead end, turn left for an awesome lunch at the micro-lunch counter called Hero, or turn right towards two of Taos' most EPIC architecture spots of all.  
  
In this little, nondescript corner of town, you'll find the oldest buildings on Taos Plaza. The buildings that are now Twirl and the Alley Cantina were started in 1800. The oldest remaining walls on the plaza are encased within them, and are more than 30 inches thick!

The Alley has decent food with a cool skylight in the main bar.

Twirl. Ah, Twirl. Okay so for your kids, this is the coolest place in New Mexico, I'd dare to say. Send them inside to the toystore or let them play in the epic back yard garden playground amazingness. For you architecturalists, just go in, roam around, enjoy the murals, and then head upstairs if its open and take in all the crazy details that developer Tom Worrell introduced to this epic space. It was SO controversial when it was done, as this kindof "ruined" one of the oldest, most historic homes in town. But I think the renovation, in another 40 years, will get put back on the historic register for its creative use of Asian and Near-Asian details. It really is quite an extraordinary space. I hope you enjoy it!  
  
As you head south, towards the plaza and back to our starting point, be sure to stop in at Kimosabe. It's not that amazing of a building but the art and antiques they have are really, really lovely, and worth a look just for the sake of the "oh, wow"s.  
  
  
  
_So this concludes my walking tour of the Taos Historic District. I hope you saw some things you liked and learned a little about our little town and it's architecture. I'll put up some [more stuff that's outside the main body of Taos](http://taosarchitecture.blogspot.com/2014/10/taos-architecture-tour-extended-outliers.html), so if you happen to be traveling in any other direction, you might find some more to enjoy. Til next time, thanks for visiting. I hope you enjoyed yourself!_  
_With love, Rachel_
