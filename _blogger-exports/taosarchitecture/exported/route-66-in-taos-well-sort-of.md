Really, during the heyday of Route 66 in New Mexico, from the late 1930's to the 1960s, the best of Americana was thought to be found on the way to LA through New Mexico. Taos, as she had for 200 years before, was a pilgrimage. Many people made it, but when they arrived they found a break from the neon highway. Taos danced to the beat of her own drum, so the style of Americana architecture and neon signs mostly avoided her. the last homages of the era can be seen in four places about town. (directions omitted to add to the quality of the victory when discovered)
