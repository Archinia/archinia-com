Labyrinth at the private event center at Blackstone Ranch

  
Pam and Charles Montgomery have created both formal and informal labyrinths at the San Geronimo Lodge on Witt Road off Kit Carson, east of town. Entrances to both the formal labyrinth and the informal one—which they call a “Prayer Path”—are just inside the San Geronimo gates on the right. Parking is shortly beyond the entrance to the paths. The formal labyrinth is beautiful, with gravel paths and riverrock stone walls that were lovingly placed by members of the family at this summer’s family reunion. The prayer path winds around the property in no formal organization and has 14 stations for rest and inspiration, each with a theme. The last 15 yards or so are lined with prayer rocks marked with the families’ prayers for both the living and the dead. Walking the Prayer Path is a creative and extraordinary experience that unfolds differently for each person.  
Katherine and Louis Costabel, former owners at the Adobe and Pines Inn, built their labyrinth on the North side of the main house at the inn this summer. Pecan hull paths circle through stacked mortared stone walls, to a center with a pond and waterfall. This labyrinth is probably the largest in town. The Adobe and Pines is at the southern end of Paseo del Pubelo Sur, on the east side of the road past Ranchos. Parking is by the bed and breakfast entrance. Walk back up the long driveway about 200 feet to the north to discover and experience this beautiful showcase labyrinth.  
  
Another new addition to the Taos labyrinth scene is at the Mabel Dodge Luhan House, which is east on Kit Carson and north on Morada. The home itself is incredible, and Taoseños and visitors alike should be sure to experience the magic history and essence of this place. The property is a private retreat center, so please be sure to ask permission to visit at the main guesthouse office. This labyrinth is lovely, with gravel walks and riverrock walls. Views of Taos Mountain peek between two trees that frame the view from the entrance.  
  
Taos artist Bren Price built the oldest labyrinth in Taos in 1999 at the Touchstone Inn on Paseo del Pueblo Norte. The labyrinth was blessed by a Native American shaman at the moment of the transition of the millennium and carries with it a ancient magic. This exquisite labyrinth, with it’s earthen paths and riverrock walls, has some of the most incredible views of Taos Mountain and is shaded by beautiful, established trees. In Spring, irises and flowers overflow the labyrinth walls into the paths. It is the most green and alive labyrinth I have ever experienced. Call the Touchstone Inn for permission to visit.  
  
The First Presbyterian Church of Taos has added a labyrinth, as has the Casa de Retiro. More details to follow.  
  
The Greater World Earthship Community is the home of a Cretan style labyrinth. The labyrinth paths are earth and the walls are stone. The labyrinth, being within the private community, can only be accessed with permission and in the presence of the owner, Michael, whose email is mjb403@yahoo.com.  
  
Hopefully, this information will invite you to wonder and reach out to experience one of these incredible sacred places, right here in Taos— to find a piece of you that you might have forgotten was there. After all, that’s what sacred space is all about.   
  
Labyrinths are open all year, weather permitting. Call ahead if you’d like to get permission and verify they are accessible.
