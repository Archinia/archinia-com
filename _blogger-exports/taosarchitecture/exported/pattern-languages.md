An Architectural Pattern Language is a way to get beyond style, beyond clich√©... to the heart of a place.It talks about values. It talks about community. It talks about form. It talks about energy and flow - whether it be pedestrian or vehicle traffic, or actual water... It also talks about spirit and sacredness.  
  
In these posts we'll start to look at the architectural details in Taos where people have chosen to place value. From these, we'll start defining a language. We'll start to see beyond style... we'll start to take where we have been and build a toolbox that we can take to create something new - an architectural system of values that's of this place, this time, and reflects our values... and respects our cultural traditions too.
