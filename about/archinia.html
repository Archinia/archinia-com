								<p>Archinia is a celebrated consulting agency with nearly twenty years of experience in preservation and architecture, as well as public relations, content creation, and community engagement around architecture, design, and historic preservation.</p>
								<p>In our preservation work, we help you get your projects ready for historic review by conducting Historic Cultural Properties Inventories, preparing National Register documentation, as well as producing measured drawings and other forms required for status review. We regularly work with local architects to help get your project ready for renovations and additions.</p>
								<p>When you hire us for marketing services, we uncover the awesome stories in your projects and then we translate them into impactful + shareable content that helps you engage with fans, your community, and we work with other designers to help connect with potential clients. We also help build capacity and community engagement so that your early-stage projects can raise the funds needed to get built.</p>

							<h2>How We Work</h2>
							<p>Archinia is a collaborative. We team with architects, landscape architects, archaeologists, historians, and technical experts in the fields required for the total success of each project. We build relationships with our clients based on integrity and openness and we encourage both clients and consultants to ask for what they need. And we start from a <a href="https://medium.com/archinia/better-than-green-design-6e04a30d3ade">high standard</a> that works WITH Nature. We utilize the <a href="https://seednetwork.org/">SEED principles</a> in our work, and run a <a href="our-green-office">green office</a> in an effort to promote social justice through good design.</p>
							<hr class="major" />
							<h2>Community</h2>
							<p>In 2014, we diversified our practice to a hybrid profit/non-profit model so that we could share what we learned with our community, especially encouraging young people to become interested in architecture, design, and preservation. Our non-profit education portal - a partnership with educational institutions, non-profits, professional organizations, leaders in design and building, and our communities - is called Architecture for EveryBody. We are fiscally sponsored by <a href="http://www.sincnm.org/">SINC / Rio Grande Community Development Corp</a> in Albuquerque.</p>
							<hr class="major" />
							<h2>Giving Back</h2>
							<p>We walk our talk by supporting the projects of our non-profit architectural education arm <A href="http://architectureforeverybody.org">Architecture for EveryBody</a>.</p>
							<hr class="major" />
							<h2>Jobs</h2>
							<p>We are always interested in hearing from researchers, interns, and draftspeople wanting to work in historic preservation, architectural documentation, and community engagement around architecture + design. <a href="mailto:intentiondesign@gmail.com">Email us</a> your resume, a sample of your work, rate sheet, and availability.</p>

Both documents are exceptional in depth and quality and fully recorded the work completed as part of this grant… as well as the documentation done… to guide future projects and long term maintenance on all these units.”</p>

Thank you so much for your help on this project.  I’m very pleased with the report and the end product and community members have not stopped commenting on how nice the houses look so congratulations on a job very well done!!!”</p>

More than once, I've been left with chills at the way she layers big-picture issues with her common-sense approach to design. To know Rachel means you will never see design (or even life, for that matter) the same way again.”</p>

									<h4>Chupadero Archeological Resources</h4>
			            <p>“Rachel Preston Prinz is a forthright, honest, hardworking and insightful team worker. I have worked with Rachel as project co-manager on a National Register nomination project. Rachel is miraculously effective in putting together team meeting and project management schedules as well as a "working manager" (producing technical contributions) for her specialty in preservation architecture and environmental design. Rachel has built ownership in the project goals on the part of all contacts, and because of her proficiency in the cyber world is able to keep open lines of communication and sharing results. If you like working with somebody honestly upbeat and forward working you will be lucky to get Rachel to work on your project as a preservation architect and or as a project manager to meet time frames and budgets.”</p>

(She) has, by all standards, a thorough architectural education, a two semester study in Italy and a summer working as an assistant in France with one of the leading Medievalists in the profession. Her personality reflects… intellectual growth and a synthesis of ideas. She also has an innate ability to understand architecture as design and as theory. I feel strongly about (her) potential as a scholar, designer and as a future university instructor.”</p>
