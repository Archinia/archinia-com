## Accessible UX

Striving to create a true a11y site that meets WCAG 2.0 AAA Guidelines.

## Guidelines

This code base uses Sass (.scss) for styling, which is combined into CSS and minified with Gulp.

### Roadmap

Right now:

- Set up JS to minify with Gulp
- Optimize images for grid layout perfection + compressed delivery

For v2 and beyond:

- Automate blog aggregation from Medium onto homepage
- Meet AAA accessibility standards on every page
