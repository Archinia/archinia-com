							<h3>What personal information about customers do Rachel Preston Prinz, Archinia, and Architecture for Everybody gather?</h3>
							<p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience. Here are the types of information we gather.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our store, marketing, and communicating with you.</li>
								<li><strong>Automatic Information:</strong> We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Rachel Preston Prinz, Archinia, and Architecture for Everybody or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of us on other Web sites.</li>
								<li><strong>E-mail Communications:</strong> If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your preferences.</li>

							<hr class="major" />
							<h3>Do Rachel Preston Prinz, Archinia, and Architecture for Everybody share the information we receive?</h3>
							<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries, partners or agents that Rachel Preston Prinz, Archinia, and Architecture for Everybody, LLC controls that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Rachel Preston Prinz, Archinia, and Architecture for Everybody, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</li>
								<li><strong>Protection of Rachel Preston Prinz, Archinia, and Architecture for Everybody and Others:</strong> We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms & Conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of our staff, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. However, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.</li>
								<li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</li>
							</ul>
							<hr class="major" />
							<h3>How Secure Is Information About Me?</h3>
							<p>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.</p>
							<p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</p>
							<hr class="major" />
							<h3>Which Information Can I Access?</h3>
							<p>Rachel Preston Prinz, Archinia, and Architecture for Everybody gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with us for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.</p>
							<hr class="major" />
							<h3>What Choices Do I Have?</h3>
							<p>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Preferences. If you do not want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of Rachel Preston Prinz, Archinia, and Architecture for Everybody, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.</p>
							<hr class="major" />
							<h3>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h3>
							<p>If you choose to visit Rachel Preston Prinz, Archinia, and Architecture for Everybody, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Policy and our Terms & Conditions, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the state of New Mexico. If you have any concern about privacy please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Policy and the Terms & Conditions will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.</p>
